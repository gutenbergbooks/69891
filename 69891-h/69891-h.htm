<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">Choderlos de Laclos</span> was the Gallic Richardson of the
XVIIIth Century; and he might more justly than Stendhal
be called the father of French realism. With inimitable
wit and the finest analysis of character he depicted the
corrupt society of his day. His aim was excellent, but
in his endeavour to point his moral he painted the vice
which he wished to flagellate in colours so glowing that
he appears more an advocate than an opponent of
immorality. In his attempt to pourtray the wiles of the
seducer for a warning to the unwary, the author of the
“Liaisons Dangereuses” produced the most complete
manual of the art of seduction; so that during the austere
reign of Charles X. this masterpiece was suppressed as
throwing too lurid a reflection on the manners and morals
of the old régime. “Les Liaisons Dangereuses” is now
for the first time literally and completely translated into
English by <span class="smcap">Mr. Ernest Dowson</span>, whose rendering of
“La Terre,” in the Lutetian Society’s issue of Zola, gained
such a warm meed of praise.</p>

<p class="p2">To render this edition of “Les Liaisons Dangereuses”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">[vi]</span>
worthy of its fame as one of the chefs-d’œuvre of Literature,
it is illustrated with fine photogravure reproductions of
the whole of the 15 charming designs by Monnet, Fragonard
fils, and Gérard, which appeared in the much coveted
French edition of 1796, and which are full of that
inexpressible grace and beauty inseparable from the work
of these Masters of French Art of the XVIIIth Century.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><a id="PUBLISHERS_NOTE"></a>PUBLISHER’S NOTE TO THE
FIRST EDITION (1784)</h2>
</div>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">We</span> think it our duty to warn the public that, in spite
of the title of this work and of what the Editor says of
it in his Preface, we do not guarantee the authenticity of
this narrative, and have even strong reasons for believing
that it is but a romance. It seems to us, moreover, that
the author, who yet seems to have sought after verisimilitude,
has himself destroyed that, and maladroitly, owing
to the period which he has chosen in which to place
these adventures. Certainly, several of the personages
whom he brings on his stage have morals so sorry that
it were impossible to believe that they lived in our
century, in this century of philosophy, where the light
shed on all sides has rendered, as everyone knows, all
men so honourable, all women so modest and reserved.</p>

<p>Our opinion is, therefore, that if the adventures related
in this work possess a foundation of truth, they could not
have occurred save in other places and in other times,
and we must censure our author, who, seduced apparently
by his hope of being more diverting by treating rather
of his own age and country, has dared to clothe in our
customs and our costumes a state of morals so remote
from us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">[viii]</span></p>

<p>To preserve the too credulous Reader, at least so far
as it lies with us, from all surprise in this matter, we will
support our opinion with an argument which we proffer
to him in all confidence, because it seems to us victorious
and unanswerable; it is that, undoubtedly, like causes should
not fail to produce like effects, and that, nevertheless, we
do not hear to-day of young ladies with incomes of sixty
thousand livres turning nuns, nor of young and pretty
dame-presidents dying of grief.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><a id="AUTHORS_PREFACE"></a>AUTHOR’S PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">This</span> work, or rather this compilation, which the public
will, perhaps, still find too voluminous, contains, however,
but a very small portion of the letters which composed
the correspondence whence it is extracted. Charged with
the care of setting it in order by the persons into whose
hands it had come, and whom I knew to have the intention
of publishing it, I asked, for reward of my pains,
no more than the permission to prune it of all that
appeared to me useless; and I have, in fact, endeavoured
to preserve only the letters which seemed to me necessary,
whether for the right understanding of events or the
development of the characters. If there be added to this
light labour that of arranging in order the letters I have
let remain, an order in which I have almost invariably
followed that of the dates, and finally some brief and
rare notes, which, for the most part, have no other object
than that of indicating the source of certain quotations,
or of explaining certain abridgments which I have permitted
myself, the share which I have had in this work will have
been told. My mission was of no wider range.</p>

<p>I had proposed alterations more considerable, and almost
all in respect of diction or style, against which will be
found many offences. I should have wished to be
authorized to cut down certain too lengthy letters, of
which several treat separately, and almost without transition,
of matters quite extraneous to one another. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">[x]</span>
task, which has not been permitted me, would doubtless
not have sufficed to give merit to the work, but it would,
at least, have freed it from a portion of its defects.</p>

<p>It has been objected to me that it was the letters
themselves which it was desirable to make public, not
merely a work made after those letters; that it would be
as great an offence against verisimilitude as against truth,
if all the eight or ten persons who participated in this
correspondence had written with an equal purity. And
to my representations that, far from that, there was not one
of them, on the contrary, who had not committed grave
faults, which would not fail to excite criticism, I was
answered that any reasonable reader would be certainly
prepared to meet with faults in a compilation of letters
written by private individuals, since in all those hitherto
published by sundry esteemed authors, and even by
certain academicians, none has proved quite free of this
reproach. These reasons have not persuaded me, and I
found them, as I find them still, easier to give than to
accept; but I was not my own master, and I gave way.
Only, I reserved to myself the right of protest, and of
declaring that I was not of that opinion: it is this protest
I make here.</p>

<p>What I must say at the outset is that, if my advice
has been, as I admit, to publish these letters, I am
nevertheless far from hoping for their success: and let
not this sincerity on my part be taken for the feigned
modesty of an author; for I declare with equal frankness
that, if this compilation had not seemed to me
worthy of being offered to the public, I would not have
meddled with it. Let us try and reconcile these apparent
contradictions.</p>

<p>The deserts of a work are composed of its utility
or of its charm, and even of both these, when it is
susceptible of them: but success, which is not always<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xi">[xi]</span>
a proof of merit, often depends more on the choice of
a subject than on its execution, on the sum of the objects
which it presents rather than on the manner in which
they are treated. Now this compilation containing, as
its title announces, the letters of a whole society, it is
dominated by a diversity of interest which weakens that
of the reader. Nay more, almost all the sentiments
therein expressed being feigned or dissimulated, they but
excite an interest of curiosity which is ever inferior to that
of sentiment, which less inclines the mind for indulgence,
and which permits a perception of the errors contained
in the details that is all the more keen in that these are
continually opposed to the only desire which one would
have satisfied.</p>

<p>These blemishes are, perhaps, redeemed, in part, by a
quality which is implied in the very nature of the work:
it is the variety of the styles, a merit which an author
attains with difficulty, but which here occurs of itself, and
at least prevents the tedium of uniformity. Many persons
will also be able to count for something a considerable
number of observations, either new or little known, which
are scattered through these letters. That is all, I fear,
that one can hope for in the matter of charm, judging
them even with the utmost favour.</p>

<p>The utility of the work, which, perhaps, will be even
more contested, yet seems to me easier to establish. It
seems to me, at any rate, that it is to render a service to
morals, to unveil the methods employed by those whose
own are bad in corrupting those whose conduct is good;
and I believe that these letters will effectually attain this
end. There will also be found the proof and example
of two important verities which one might believe unknown,
for that they are so rarely practised: the one, that every
woman who consents to admit a man of loose morals to
her society ends by becoming his victim; the other, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xii">[xii]</span>
a mother is, to say the least, imprudent who allows
any other than herself to possess the confidence of her
daughter. Young people of either sex might also learn
from these pages that the friendship which persons of
evil character appear to grant them so readily is never
aught else but a dangerous snare, as fatal to their happiness
as to their virtue. Abuse, however, always so near a
neighbour to what is good, seems to me here too greatly
to be feared; and far from commending this work for the
perusal of youth, it seems to me most important to deter
it from all such reading. The time when it may cease
to be perilous and become useful seems to me to have
been defined, for her sex, by a good mother, who has
not only wit but good sense: “I should deem,” she said
to me, after having read the manuscript of this correspondence,
“that I was doing a service to my daughter,
if I gave her this book on the day of her marriage.”
If all mothers of families think thus, I shall congratulate
myself on having published it.</p>

<p>But if, again, we put this favourable supposition on one
side, I continue to think that this collection can please
very few. Men and women who are depraved will have
an interest in decrying a work calculated to injure them;
and, as they are not lacking in skill, perhaps they will
have sufficient to bring to their side the austere, who will
be alarmed at the picture of bad morals which we have
not feared to exhibit.</p>

<p>The would-be free-thinkers will not be interested in a
God-fearing woman whom for that very reason they will
regard as a ninny; while pious people will be angry at
seeing virtue defeated and will complain that religion is
not made to seem more powerful.</p>

<p>On the other hand, persons of delicate taste will be
disgusted by the too simple and too faulty style of many
of these letters; while the mass of readers, led away with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</span>
the idea that everything they see in print is the fruit
of labour, will think that they are beholding in certain
others the elaborate method of an author concealing
himself behind the person whom he causes to speak.</p>

<p>Lastly, it will perhaps be pretty generally said that
everything is good in its own place; and that, although,
as a rule, the too polished style of the authors detracts
from the charm of the letters of society, the carelessness
of the present ones becomes a real fault and makes them
insufferable when sent to the printer’s.</p>

<p>I sincerely admit that all these reproaches may be well
founded: I think also that I should be able to reply to
them without exceeding the length permissible to a preface.
But it must be plain that, to make it necessary to reply
to all, the book itself should be unable to reply to any;
and that, had I been of this opinion I would have
suppressed at once the preface and the book.</p>

<small>CÉCILE VOLANGES TO SOPHIE CARNAY, AT THE
URSULINES OF ....</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">You</span> see, my dear friend, that I keep my word to you,
and that bonnets and frills do not take up all my time;
there will always be some left for you. However, I have
seen more adornments in this one single day than in all
the four years we passed together; and I think that the
superb Tanville<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> will have more vexation at my first visit,
when I shall certainly ask to see her, than she has ever
fancied that she afforded us, when she used to come and
see us in <i>fiocchi</i>. Mamma has consulted me in everything;
she treats me much less as a school-girl than of old. I
have a waiting-maid of my own; I have a room and a
closet at my disposition; and I write this to you at a
very pretty desk, of which I have the key, and where I can
lock up all that I wish. Mamma has told me that I am
to see her every day when she rises, that I need not have
my hair dressed before dinner, because we shall always<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
be alone, and that then she will tell me every day where
I am to see her in the afternoon. The rest of the time
is at my disposal, and I have my harp, my drawing, and
books as at the convent, only there is no Mother Perpétue
here to scold me, and it is nothing to anybody but myself,
if I choose to do nothing at all. But as I have not
my Sophie here to sing and laugh with, I would just as
soon occupy myself.</p>

<p>It is not yet five o’clock; I have not to go and join
Mamma until seven: there’s time enough, if I had anything
to tell you! But as yet they have not spoken to me of
anything, and were it not for the preparations I see being
made, and the number of milliners who all come for me,
I should believe that they had no thought of marrying
me, and that that was the nonsense of the good Joséphine.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
However, Mamma has told me so often that a young
lady should stay in the convent until she marries that,
since she has taken me out, I suppose Joséphine was
right.</p>

<p>A carriage has just stopped at the door, and Mamma
tells me to come to her at once. If it were to be the
Gentleman! I am not dressed, my hand trembles and
my heart is beating. I asked my waiting-maid if she
knew who was with my mother. “Certainly,” she said,
“it’s Monsieur C***.” And she laughed. Oh, I believe
’tis he! I will be sure to come back and relate to you
what passes. There is his name, at any rate. I must
not keep him waiting. For a moment, adieu....</p>

<p>How you will laugh at your poor Cécile! Oh, I have
really been disgraceful! But you would have been caught<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
just as I. When I went in to Mamma, I saw a gentleman
in black standing by her. I bowed to him as well as I
could, and stood still without being able to budge an inch.
You can imagine how I scrutinized him.</p>

<p>“Madame,” he said to my mother, as he bowed to
me, “what a charming young lady! I feel more than
ever the value of your kindness.” At this very definite
remark, I was seized with a fit of trembling, so much so
that I could hardly stand: I found an arm-chair and sat
down in it, very red and disconcerted. Hardly was I
there, when I saw the man at my feet. Your poor Cécile
quite lost her head; as Mamma said, I was absolutely
terrified. I jumped up, uttering a piercing cry, just as I
did that day when it thundered. Mamma burst out
laughing, saying to me, “Well! what is the matter with
you? Sit down, and give your foot to Monsieur.” Indeed,
my dear friend, the gentleman was a shoe-maker. I can’t
describe to you how ashamed I was; mercifully there
was no one there but Mamma. I think that, when I am
married, I shall give up employing that shoe-maker.</p>

<p>So much for our wisdom—admit it! Adieu. It is
nearly six o’clock, and my waiting-maid tells me that I
must dress. Adieu, my dear Sophie, I love you, just as
well as if I were still at the convent.</p>

<p>P.S. I don’t know by whom to send my letter, so that
I shall wait until Joséphine comes.</p>

<br>
<small>THE MARQUISE DE MERTEUIL TO THE VICOMTE DE VALMONT,
AT THE CHÂTEAU DE ....</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">Come</span> back, my dear Vicomte, come back; what are you
doing, what <i>can</i> you be doing with an old aunt, whose
whole property is settled on you? Set off at once; I have
need of you. I have an excellent idea, and I should like
to confide its execution to you. A very few words should
suffice; and only too honoured at my choice, you ought to
come, with enthusiasm, to receive my orders on your knees:
but you abuse my kindness, even since you have ceased
to take advantage of it, and between the alternatives of
an eternal hatred and excessive indulgence, your happiness
demands that my indulgence wins the day. I am willing
then to inform you of my projects, but swear to me like
a faithful cavalier that you embark on no other adventure
till this one be brought to an end. It is worthy of a
hero: you will serve both love and vengeance; it will be,
in short, one <i>rouerie</i><a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> the more to include in your Memoirs:
yes, in your Memoirs, for I wish them to be printed, and I
will charge myself with the task of writing them. But let
us leave that, and come back to what is occupying me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span></p>

<p>Madame de Volanges is marrying her daughter: it is still
a secret, but she imparted it to me yesterday. And whom
do you think she has chosen for her son-in-law? The
Comte de Gercourt. Who would have thought that I
should ever become Gercourt’s cousin? I was furious....
Well! do you not divine me now? Oh, dull brains!
Have you forgiven him then the adventure of the Intendante!
And I, have I not still more cause to complain
of him, monster that you are?<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> But I will calm myself,
and the hope of vengeance soothes my soul.</p>

<p>You have been bored a hundred times, like myself,
by the importance which Gercourt sets upon the wife who
shall be his, and by his fatuous presumption, which leads
him to believe he will escape the inevitable fate. You
know his ridiculous precautions as to conventual education
and his even more ridiculous prejudice in favour of the
discretion of <i>blondes</i>. In fact, I would wager, that for
all that the little Volanges has an income of sixty thousand
livres, he would never have made this marriage if she
had been dark or had not been bred at the convent.
Let us prove to him then that he is but a fool: no doubt
he will be made so one of these days; it isn’t that of
which I am afraid; but ’twould be pleasant indeed if
he were to make his <i>début</i> as one! How we should amuse
ourselves on the day after, when we heard him boasting,
for he will boast; and then, if you once form this little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
girl, it would be a rare mishap if Gercourt did not
become, like another man, the joke of all Paris.</p>

<p>For the rest, the heroine of this new romance merits
all your attentions: she is really pretty; it is only fifteen,
’tis a rose-bud, <i>gauche</i> in truth, incredibly so, and quite
without affectation. But you men are not afraid of that;
moreover, a certain languishing glance, which really promises
great things. Add to this that I exhort you to it:
you can only thank me and obey.</p>

<p>You will receive this letter to-morrow morning. I request
that to-morrow, at seven o’clock in the evening, you may
be with me. I shall receive nobody until eight, not even
the reigning Chevalier: he has not head enough for such
a mighty piece of work. You see that love does not
blind me. At eight o’clock I will grant you your liberty,
and you shall come back at ten to sup with the fair
object; for mother and daughter will sup with me. Adieu,
it is past noon: soon I shall have put you out of my
thoughts.</p>

<small>CÉCILE VOLANGES TO SOPHIE CARNAY</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">I know</span> nothing as yet, my dear friend. Mamma had a
great number of people to supper yesterday. In spite of
the interest I took in regarding them, the men especially, I
was far from being diverted. Men and women, everybody
looked at me mightily, and then would whisper to
one another, and I saw they were speaking of me. That
made me blush; I could not prevent myself. I wish I
could have, for I noticed that, when the other women
were looked at, they did not blush: or perhaps ’tis the
rouge they employ which prevents one seeing the red
that is caused by embarrassment; for it must be very difficult
not to blush when a man stares at you.</p>

<p>What made me most uneasy was that I did not know
what they thought in my regard. I believe, however, that
I heard two or three times the word <i>pretty</i>; but I heard
very distinctly the word <i>gauche</i>; and I think that must be
true, for the woman who said it is a kinswoman and
friend of my mother; she seemed even to have suddenly
taken a liking to me. She was the only person who
spoke to me a little during the evening. We are to sup
with her to-morrow.</p>

<p>I also heard, after supper, a man who, I am certain,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
was speaking of me, and who said to another, “We must
let it ripen; this winter we shall see.” It is, perhaps, he
who is to marry me, but then it will not be for four
months! I should so much like to know how it stands.</p>

<p>Here is Joséphine, and she tells me she is in a hurry.
Yet I must tell you one more of my <i>gaucheries</i>. Oh, I
am afraid that lady was right!</p>

<p>After supper they started to play. I placed myself at
Mamma’s side; I do not know how it happened, but I
fell asleep almost at once. I was awakened by a great
burst of laughter. I do not know if they were laughing
at me, but I believe so. Mamma gave me permission to
retire, and I was greatly pleased. Imagine, it was past
eleven o’clock. Adieu, my dear Sophie; always love your
Cécile. I assure you that the world is not so amusing as
we imagined.</p>

<small>THE VICOMTE DE VALMONT TO THE MARQUISE DE MERTEUIL,
AT PARIS</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">Your</span> commands are charming; your fashion of conveying
them is more gracious still; you would make us in love
with despotism. It is not the first time, as you know, that
I have regretted that I am no longer your slave: and
<i>monster</i> though I be, according to you, I never recall
without pleasure the time when you honoured me with
sweeter titles. Indeed, I often desire to merit them
again, and to end by setting, with you, an example of
constancy to the world. But greater interests call us; to
conquer is our destiny, we must follow it; perhaps at the
end of the course we shall meet again; for, may I say it
without vexing you, my fairest Marquise? you follow it at
least as fast as I: and since the day when, separating
for the good of the world, we began to preach the faith
on our different sides, it seems to me that, in this mission
of love, you have made more proselytes than I. I
know your zeal, your ardent fervour; and if that god of
ours judged us by our works, you would one day be the
patroness of some great city, whilst your friend would be
at most but a village saint. This language astounds you,
does it not? But for the last week I hear and speak no
other, and it is to perfect myself in it that I am forced
to disobey you.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span></p>

<p>Listen to me and do not be vexed. Depositary of all
the secrets of my heart, I will confide to you the most
important project I have ever formed. What is it you
suggest to me? To seduce a young girl, who has seen
nothing, knows nothing, who would be, so to speak, delivered
defenceless into my hands, whom a first compliment
would not fail to intoxicate, and whom curiosity will perhaps
more readily entice than love. Twenty others can
succeed and these as well as I. That is not the case in
the adventure which engrosses me; its success insures me
as much glory as pleasure. Love, who prepares my
crown, hesitates, himself, betwixt the myrtle and the laurel;
or rather he will unite them to honour my triumph. You
yourself, my fair friend, will be seized with a holy veneration
and will say with enthusiasm, “Behold a man after
my own heart!”</p>

<p>You know the Présidente de Tourvel, her piety, her
conjugal love, her austere principles. She it is whom I
am attacking; there is the foe meet for me; there the goal
at which I dare to aim:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Et si de l’obtenir, je n’emporte le prix,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">J’aurai du moins l’honneur de l’avoir entrepris.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>One may quote bad verses when a good poet has
written them. You must know then that the President is
in Burgundy, in consequence of some great law-suit: I
hope to make him lose one of greater import! His disconsolate
better-half has to pass here the whole term of this
distressing widowhood. Mass every day; some visits to
the poor of the district; morning and evening prayers,
solitary walks, pious interviews with my old aunt, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
sometimes a dismal game of whist, must be her sole
distractions. I am preparing some for her which shall be
more efficacious. My guardian angel has brought me here,
for her happiness and my own. Madman that I was, I
regretted twenty-four hours which I was sacrificing to my
respect for the conventions. How I should be punished if
I were made to return to Paris! Luckily, four are needed
to play whist; and as there is no one here but the <i>curé</i>
of the place, my eternal aunt has pressed me greatly to
sacrifice a few days to her. You can guess that I have
agreed. You cannot imagine how she has cajoled me since
then, above all how edified she is at my regularity at prayers
and mass. She has no suspicion what divinity I adore.</p>

<p>Here am I then for the last four days, in the
throes of a doughty passion. You know how keen are
my desires, how I brush aside obstacles to them: but
what you do not know is how solitude adds ardour to
desire. I have but one idea; I think of it all day and
dream of it all night. It is very necessary that I should
have this woman, if I would save myself from the ridicule
of being in love with her: for whither may not thwarted
desire lead one? O delicious pleasure! I implore thee
for my happiness, and above all for my repose. How
lucky it is for us that women defend themselves so badly!
Else we should be to them no more than timid slaves.
At present I have a feeling of gratitude for yielding
women which brings me naturally to your feet. I prostrate
myself to implore your pardon, and so conclude this too
long epistle.</p>

<p>Adieu, my fairest friend, and bear me no malice.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="LETTER_THE_FIFTH">LETTER THE FIFTH<br>

<small>THE MARQUISE DE MERTEUIL TO THE VICOMTE DE VALMONT</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="noin">Do you know, Vicomte, that your letter is of an
amazing insolence, and that I have every excuse to be
angry with you? But it has proved clearly to me that you
have lost your head, and that alone has saved you from
my indignation. Like a generous and sympathetic friend,
I forget my wrongs in order to concern myself with your
peril; and tiresome though argument be, I give way before
the need you have of it, at such a time.</p>

<p>You, to have the Présidente de Tourvel! The ridiculous
caprice! I recognize there your froward imagination, which
knows not how to desire aught but what it believes to be
unattainable. What is the woman then? Regular features,
if you like, but no expression; passably made, but lacking
grace; and always dressed in a fashion to set you laughing,
with her clusters of fichus on her bosom and her body
running into her chin! I warn you as a friend, you need
but to have two such women, and all your consideration
will be lost. Remember the day when she collected at
Saint-Roch, and when you thanked me so for having
procured you such a spectacle. I think I see her still, giving
her hand to that great gawk with the long hair, stumbling
at every step, with her four yards of collecting-bag always<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
over somebody’s head, and blushing at every reverence.
Who would have said then that you would ever desire
this woman? Come, Vicomte, blush too, and be yourself
again! I promise to keep your secret.</p>

<p>And then, look at the disagreeables which await you!
What rival have you to encounter? A husband! Are
you not humiliated at the very word? What a disgrace
if you fail! and how little glory even if you succeed! I
say more; expect no pleasure from it. Is there ever any
with your prudes? I mean those in good faith. Reserved
in the very midst of pleasure, they give you but a half-enjoyment.
That utter self-abandonment, that delirium of
joy, where pleasure is purified by its excess, those good
things of love are not known to them. I warn you: in
the happiest supposition, your Présidente will think she
has done everything for you, if she treats you as her
husband; and in the most tender of conjugal <i>tête-à-têtes</i>
you are always two. Here it is even worse; your prude
is a <i>dévote</i>, with that devotion of worthy women which
condemns them to eternal infancy. Perhaps you will
overcome that obstacle; but do not flatter yourself that
you will destroy it: victorious over the love of God, you
will not be so over the fear of the Devil; and when,
holding your mistress in your arms, you feel her heart
palpitate, it will be from fear and not from love. Perhaps,
if you had known this woman earlier, you would have
been able to make something of her; but it is two-and-twenty,
and has been married nearly two years. Believe
me, Vicomte, when a woman is so <i>incrusted</i> with prejudice,
it is best to abandon her to her fate; she will never be
anything but a <i>puppet</i>.</p>

<p>Yet it is for this delightful creature that you refuse to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
obey me, bury yourself in the tomb of your aunt, and
renounce the most enticing of adventures, and withal one
so admirably suited to do you honour. By what fatality
then must Gercourt always hold some advantage over
you? Well, I am writing to you without temper: but, for
the nonce, I am tempted to believe that you don’t merit
your reputation; I am tempted, above all, to withdraw
my confidence from you. I shall never get used to telling
my secrets to the lover of Madame de Tourvel.</p>

<p>I must let you know, however, that the little Volanges
has already turned one head. Young Danceny is wild
about her. He sings duets with her; and really, she sings
better than a school-girl should. They must rehearse a
good many duets, and I think that she takes nicely to the
<i>unison</i>; but this Danceny is a child, who will waste his
time in making love and will never finish. The little person,
on her side, is shy enough; and in any event it will be
much less amusing than you could have made it: wherefore
I am in a bad humour and shall certainly quarrel with the
Chevalier at his next appearance. I advise him to be
gentle; for, at this moment, it would cost me nothing to
break with him. I am sure that, if I had the sense to
leave him at present, he would be in despair; and nothing
amuses me so much as a lover’s despair. He would call
me perfidious, and that word “perfidious” has always
pleased me; it is, after the word “cruel,” the sweetest to
a woman’s ear, and less difficult to deserve.... Seriously,
I shall have to set about this rupture. There’s what you
are the cause of; so I put it on your conscience! Adieu.
Recommend me to the prayers of your lady President.</p>

<br>
 <small>THE VICOMTE DE VALMONT TO THE MARQUISE DE MERTEUIL</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">There</span> is never a woman then but abuses the empire
she has known how to seize! And yourself, you whom
I have so often dubbed my indulgent friend, you have
discarded the title and are not afraid to attack me in the
object of my affections! With what traits you venture to
depict Madame de Tourvel!... What man but would
have paid with his life for such insolent boldness? What
woman other than yourself would have escaped without
receiving at least an ungracious retort? In mercy, put
me not to such tests; I will not answer for my power to
sustain them. In the name of friendship, wait until I
have had this woman, if you wish to revile her. Do you
not know that pleasure alone has the right to remove the
bandage from Love’s eyes? But what am I saying? Has
Madame de Tourvel any need of illusion? No; for to
be adorable, she has only need to be herself. You reproach
her with dressing badly; I quite agree: all adornment is
hurtful to her, nothing that conceals her adorns. It is
in the freedom of her <i>négligé</i> that she is really ravishing.
Thanks to the distressing heat which we are experiencing,
a <i>déshabillé</i> of simple stuff permits me to see her round
and supple figure. Only a piece of muslin covers her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
breast; and my furtive but penetrating gaze has already
seized its enchanting form. Her face, say you, has no
expression. And, what should it express, in moments when
nothing speaks to her heart? No, doubtless, she has not,
like our coquettes, that false glance, which is sometimes
seductive and always deceives. She knows not how to
gloss over the emptiness of a phrase by a studied smile,
and although she has the loveliest teeth in the world, she
never laughs, except when she is amused. But you should
see, in some frolicsome game, of what a frank and
innocent gaiety she will present the image! Near some
poor wretch whom she is eager to succour, what a pure
joy and compassionate kindness her gaze denotes! You
should see, above all, how, at the least word of praise or
flattery, her heavenly face is tinged with the touching
embarrassment of a modesty that is not feigned!... She
is a prude and devout, and so you judge her to be cold
and inanimate? I think very differently. What amazing
sensibility she must have, that it can reach even her
husband, and that she can always love a person who is
always absent? What stronger proof would you desire?
Yet I have been able to procure another.</p>

<p>I directed her walk in such a manner that a ditch had
to be crossed; and, although she is very agile, she is even
more timid. You can well believe how much a prude
fears to <i>cross the ditch</i>!<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> She was obliged to trust herself
to me. I held this modest woman in my arms. Our
preparations and the passage of my old aunt had caused
the playful <i>dévote</i> to peal with laughter; but when I had
once taken hold of her, by a happy awkwardness our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
arms were interlaced. I pressed her breast against my
own; and in this short interval, I felt her heart beat
faster. An amiable flush suffused her face; and her modest
embarrassment taught me well enough <i>that her heart had
throbbed with love and not with fear</i>. My aunt, however,
was deceived, as you are, and said, “The child was
frightened,” but the charming candour of <i>the child</i> did not
permit her to lie, and she answered naively, “Oh no,
but....” That alone was an illumination. From that
moment the sweetness of hope has succeeded to my cruel
uncertainty. I shall possess this woman; I shall steal her
from the husband who profanes her: I will even dare
ravish her from the God whom she adores. What delight,
to be in turns the object and the victor of her remorse!
Far be it from me to destroy the prejudices which sway
her mind! They will add to my happiness and my
triumph. Let her believe in virtue, and sacrifice it to me;
let the idea of falling terrify her, without preventing her
fall; and may she, shaken by a thousand terrors, forget
them, vanquish them only in my arms. Then, I agree,
let her say to me, “I adore thee;” she, alone among
women, is worthy to pronounce these words. I shall be
truly the God whom she has preferred.</p>

<p>Let us be candid: in our arrangements, as cold as they
are facile, what we call happiness is hardly even a pleasure.
Shall I tell you? I thought my heart was withered; and
finding nothing left but my senses, I lamented my premature
old age. Madame de Tourvel has restored to me the
charming illusions of youth. With her I have no need of
pleasure to be happy. The only thing which frightens
me is the time which this adventure is going to take;
for I dare leave nothing to chance. ’Tis in vain I recall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
my fortunate audacities; I cannot bring myself to put
them in practice here. To become truly happy, I require
her to give herself; and that is no slight affair.</p>

<p>I am sure that you admire my prudence. I have not
yet pronounced the word “love;” but we have already
come to those of confidence and interest. To deceive her
as little as possible, and above all to counteract the effect
of stories which might come to her ears, I have myself
told her, as though in self-accusation, of some of my most
notorious traits. You would laugh to see the candour
with which she lectures me. She wishes, she says, to convert
me. She has no suspicion as yet of what it will cost her
to try. She is far from thinking, that <i>in pleading</i>, to use
her own words, <i>for the unfortunates I have ruined</i>, she
speaks in anticipation in her own cause. This idea struck
me yesterday in the midst of one of her dissertations,
and I could not resist the pleasure of interrupting her to
tell her that she spoke like a prophet. Adieu, my fairest
of friends. You see that I am not lost beyond all hope
of return.</p>

<p>P.S. By the way, that poor Chevalier—has he killed
himself from despair? Truly, you are a hundredfold
naughtier person than myself, and you would humiliate
me, if I had any vanity.</p>

</div>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">If</span> I have told you nothing about my marriage, it is because
I know no more about it than I did the first day.
I am accustoming myself to think no more of it, and I am
quite satisfied with my manner of life. I study much at my
singing and my harp; it seems to me that I like them
better since I have no longer a master, or perhaps it is
because I have a better one. M. le Chevalier Danceny,
the gentleman of whom I told you, and with whom I sang
at Madame de Merteuil’s, is kind enough to come here
every day, and to sing with me for whole hours. He is
extremely amiable. He sings like an angel, and composes
very pretty airs, to which he also does the words. It is
a great pity that he is a Knight of Malta! It seems to
me that, if he were to marry, his wife would be very
happy.... He has a charming gentleness. He never has
the air of paying you a compliment, and yet everything
he says flatters you. He takes me up constantly, now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
about my music, now about something else; but he mingles
his criticisms with so much gaiety and interest, that it is
impossible not to be grateful for them. If he only looks at
you, it seems as though he were saying something gracious.
Added to all that, he is very obliging. For instance,
yesterday he was invited to a great concert; he preferred
to spend the whole evening at Mamma’s. That pleased
me very much; for, when he is not here, nobody talks
to me, and I bore myself: whereas, when he is here,
we sing and talk together. He and Madame de Merteuil
are the only two persons I find amiable. But adieu, my
dearest friend; I have promised to learn for to-day a little
air with a very difficult accompaniment, and I would not
break my word. I am going to practise it until he comes.</p>

<small>THE PRÉSIDENTE DE TOURVEL TO MADAME DE VOLANGES</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="noin">No one, Madame, can be more sensible than I to the
confidence you show in me, nor take a keener interest in
the establishment of Mademoiselle de Volanges. It is,
indeed, from my whole heart that I wish her a happiness
of which I make no doubt she is worthy, and which your
prudence will secure. I do not know M. le Comte de
Gercourt; but being honoured by your choice, I cannot
but form a favourable opinion of him. I confine myself,
Madame, to wishing for this marriage a success as assured
as my own, which is equally your handiwork, and for
which each fresh day adds to my gratitude. May the
happiness of your daughter be the reward of that which
you have procured for me; and may the best of friends
be also the happiest of mothers!</p>

<p>I am really grieved that I cannot offer you by word
of mouth the homage of this sincere wish, nor make the
acquaintance of Mademoiselle de Volanges so soon as I
should wish. After having known your truly maternal
kindness, I have a right to hope from her the tender
friendship of a sister. I beg you, Madame, to be so good
as to ask this from her in my behalf, while I wait until
I have the opportunity of deserving it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span></p>

<p>I expect to remain in the country all the time of M.
de Tourvel’s absence. I have taken advantage of this
leisure to enjoy and profit by the society of the venerable
Madame de Rosemonde. This lady is always charming;
her great age has deprived her of nothing; she retains all
her memory and sprightliness. Her body alone is eighty-four
years old; her mind is only twenty.</p>

<p>Our seclusion is enlivened by her nephew, the Vicomte
de Valmont, who has cared to devote a few days to us.
I knew him only by his reputation, which gave me small
desire to make his acquaintance; but he seems to me to
be better than that. Here, where he is not spoilt by the
hubbub of the world, he talks rationally with extraordinary
ease, and excuses himself for his errors with rare candour.
He speaks to me with much confidence, and I preach to
him with great severity. You, who know him, will admit
that it would be a fine conversion to make: but I suspect,
in spite of his promises, that a week of Paris will make
him forget all my sermons. His sojourn here will be at
least so much saved from his ordinary course of conduct;
and I think, from his fashion of life, that what he can
best do is to do nothing at all. He knows that I am
engaged in writing to you and has charged me to present
you with his respectful homage. Pray accept my own
also, with the goodness that I know in you; and never
doubt the sincere sentiments with which I have the honour
to be, etc.</p>

<br>
<small>MADAME DE VOLANGES TO THE PRÉSIDENTE DE TOURVEL</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="noin">I <span class="smcap">have</span> never doubted, my fair and youthful friend, either
of the kindness which you have for me, or of the sincere
interest which you take in all that concerns me. It is
not to elucidate that point, which I hope is settled between
us, that I reply to your <i>reply</i>; but I cannot refrain from
having a talk with you on the subject of the Vicomte de
Valmont.</p>

<p>I did not expect, I confess, ever to come across that
name in your letters. Indeed, what can there be in
common between you and him? You do not know this
man; where should you have obtained any idea of the
soul of a libertine? You speak to me of his <i>rare candour</i>:
yes, indeed, the candour of Valmont must be most rare.
Even more false and dangerous than he is amiable and
seductive, never since his extreme youth has he taken a
step or uttered a word without having some end in view
which was either dishonourable or criminal. My dear, you
know me; you know whether, of all the virtues which I
try to acquire, charity be not the one which I cherish the
most. So that, if Valmont were led away by the vehemence
of his passions; if, like a thousand others, he were seduced
by the errors of his age: while I should blame his conduct,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
I should pity him personally, and wait in silence for the
time when a happy reformation should restore him the
esteem of honest folk. But Valmont is not like that: his
conduct is the consequence of his principles. He can
calculate to a nicety how many atrocities a man may
allow himself to commit, without compromising himself;
and, in order to be cruel and mischievous with impunity,
he has selected women to be his victims. I will not stop
to count all those whom he has seduced: but how many
has he not ruined utterly?</p>

<p>In the quiet and retired life which you lead, these
scandalous stories do not reach your ears. I could tell
you some which would make you shudder; but your eyes,
which are as pure as your soul, would be defiled by such
pictures: secure of being in no danger from Valmont, you
have no need of such arms wherewith to defend yourself.
The only thing which I may tell you is that out of all
the women to whom he has paid attention, with or without
success, there is not one who has not had cause to complain
of him. The Marquise de Merteuil is the single exception
to this general rule; she alone knew how to withstand and
disarm his villainy. I must confess that this episode in
her life is that which does her most honour in my eyes:
it has also sufficed to justify her fully, in the eyes of all,
for certain inconsistencies with which one had to reproach
her at the commencement of her widowhood.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>However this may be, my fair friend, what age, experience,
and above all, friendship, empower me to represent
to you is that the absence of Valmont is beginning to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
noticed, in the world; and that, if it becomes known that
he has for some time made a third party to his aunt
and you, your reputation will be in his hands: the greatest
misfortune which can befall a woman. I advise you then
to persuade his aunt not to keep him there longer; and,
if he insists upon remaining, I think you should not hesitate
to leave him in possession. But why should he stay?
What is he doing in your part of the country? If you were
to spy upon his proceedings, I am sure you would discover
that he only came there to have a more convenient shelter
for some black deed he is contemplating in the neighbourhood.
But, as it is impossible to remedy the evil, let
us be content by ourselves avoiding it.</p>

<p>Farewell, my lovely friend; at present the marriage of
my daughter is a little delayed. The Comte de Gercourt,
whom we expected from day to day, tells me that his
regiment is ordered to Corsica; and as military operations
are still afoot, it will be impossible for him to absent
himself before the winter. This vexes me; but it causes
me to hope that we shall have the pleasure of seeing you
at the wedding; and I was sorry that it was to have taken
place without you. Adieu; I am, unreservedly and without
compliment, entirely yours.</p>

<p>P.S. Recall me to the recollection of Madame de
Rosemonde, whom I always love as dearly as she deserves.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="LETTER_THE_TENTH">LETTER THE TENTH
<br>
 <small>THE MARQUISE DE MERTEUIL TO THE VICOMTE DE VALMONT</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">Vicomte</span>, are you angry with me? Or are you, indeed,
dead? Or, what would not be unlike that, are you living
only for your Présidente? This woman, who has restored
you <i>the illusions of youth</i>, will soon restore you also its
ridiculous prejudices. Here you are already timid and a
slave; you might as well be amorous. You renounce <i>your
fortunate audacities</i>. Behold you then conducting yourself
without principles, and trusting all to hazard, or rather to
caprice. Do you no longer remember that love, like
medicine, is nothing but the <i>art of assisting nature</i>? You
see that I beat you with your own arms, but I will not
plume myself on that: it is indeed beating a man when
he is down. <i>She must give herself</i>, you tell me. Ah,
no doubt, she must; she will give herself like the others,
with this difference, that it will be with a bad grace.</p>

<p>But if the end is that she should give herself, the true
way is to begin by taking her. This absurd distinction
is indeed a true sign of love’s madness! I say love; for
you are in love. To speak to you otherwise would be
to cheat you, it would be to hide from you your ill.
Tell me then, languid lover, the women whom you have
had, did you think you had violated them? Why, however<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
desirous one may be of giving one’s self, however eager one
may be, one still needs a pretext; and is there any more convenient
for us than that which gives us the air of yielding
to force? For me, I confess, one of the things which
flatter me the most is a well-timed and lively assault,
where everything succeeds in order, although with rapidity;
which never throws us into the painful embarrassment of
having ourselves to repair a <i>gaucherie</i> from which, on the
contrary, we should have profited; which is cunning to
maintain the air of violence even in things which we grant,
and to flatter adroitly our two favourite passions, the glory of
resistance and the pleasure of defeat. I grant that this
talent, rarer than one may think, has always given me
pleasure, even when it has not seduced me, and that
sometimes, solely for recompense, it has induced me to
yield. So, in our ancient tourneys, beauty gave the prize
of valour and skill.</p>

<p>But you, who are no longer you, are behaving as if you
were afraid of success. Ah! since when do you travel by
short stages and cross-roads? My friend, when one wishes
to arrive, post-horses and the highway! But let us drop
this subject, which is all the more distasteful to me in
that it deprives me of the pleasure of seeing you. At
least write to me more often than you do, and keep me
informed of your progress. Do you know that it is now
more than a fortnight since you have been occupied by this
ridiculous adventure, and have neglected all the world?</p>

<p><i>À propos</i> of negligence, you are like those people who
send regularly to enquire after their sick friends, but who
never trouble to get a reply. You finish your last
letter by asking me if the Chevalier be dead. I do not
answer, and you are no longer in the least concerned.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
Are you no longer aware that my lover is your born
friend? But reassure yourself, he is not dead; or if he
were, it would be for excess of joy. This poor Chevalier,
how tender he is! how excellently is he made for love! how
well he knows how to feel intensely! It makes my head reel.
Seriously, the perfect happiness which he derives from
being loved by me gives me a real attachment for him.</p>

<p>The very same day upon which I wrote to you that
I was going to promote a rupture, how happy I made
him! Yet I was mightily occupied, when they announced
him, about the means of putting him in despair. Was it
reason or caprice: he never seemed to me so fine.
I nevertheless received him with temper. He hoped to
pass two hours with me, before the time when my door
would be open to everybody. I told him that I was going
out: he asked me whither I was going; I refused to tell
him. He insisted: “Where I shall not have your company,”
I answered acidly. Luckily for himself, he stood as
though petrified by this answer; for had he said a word, a
scene would infallibly have ensued which would have led
to the projected rupture. Astonished by his silence, I
cast my eyes upon him, with no other intention, upon my
oath, than to see what countenance he would shew. I
discovered on that charming face that sorrow, at once so
tender and so profound, to which, you yourself have
admitted, it is so difficult to resist. Like causes produce
like effects: I was vanquished a second time.</p>

<p>From that moment, I was only busy in finding a means
of preventing him from having a grievance against me. “I
am going out on business,” said I, with a somewhat gentler
air; “nay, even on business which concerns you; but do
not question me further. I shall sup at home; return, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
you shall know all.” At this he recovered the power of
speech; but I did not permit him to use it “I am in
great haste,” I continued; “leave me, until this evening.”
He kissed my hand and went away.</p>

<p>Immediately, to compensate him, perhaps to compensate
myself, I decide to acquaint him with my <i>petite maison</i>, of
which he had no suspicion. I called my faithful Victoire.
I have my head-ache; I am gone to bed, for all my
household; and left alone at last with my <i>Trusty</i>, whilst
she disguises herself as a lackey, I don the costume of a
waiting-maid. She next calls a hackney-coach to the gate
of my garden, and behold us on our way! Arrived in
this temple of love, I chose the most gallant of <i>déshabillés</i>.
This one is delicious; it is my own invention: it lets
nothing be seen and yet allows you to divine all. I promise
you a pattern of it for your Présidente, when you
have rendered her worthy to wear it.</p>

<p>After these preliminaries, whilst Victoire busies herself
with other details, I read a chapter of <i>Le Sopha</i>,<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> a letter
of Héloïse and two Tales of La Fontaine, in order to
rehearse the different tones which I would assume. Meantime,
my Chevalier arrives at my door with his accustomed
zeal. My porter denies him, and informs him that I am
ill: incident the first. At the same time he hands him a
note from me, but not in my hand-writing, after my
prudent rule. He opens it and sees written therein in
Victoire’s hand: “At nine o’clock, punctually, on the Boulevard,
in front of the <i>cafés</i>.” Thither he betakes himself,
and there a little lackey whom he does not know, whom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
he believes, at least, that he does not know, for of course it
was Victoire, comes and informs him that he must dismiss
his carriage and follow her. All this romantic promenade
helped all the more to heat his mind, and a hot head
is by no means undesirable. At last, he arrives, and love
and amazement produced in him a veritable enchantment.
To give him time to recover, we strolled out for a while
in the little wood; then I took him back again to the house.
He sees, at first, two covers laid; then a bed prepared.
We pass into the boudoir, which was richly adorned.
There, half pensively, half in sentiment, I threw my arms
round him, and fell on my knees.</p>

<p>“O my friend,” said I, “in my desire to reserve the
surprise of this moment for you, I reproach myself with
having grieved you with a pretence of ill-humour; with
having been able, for an instant, to veil my heart to your
gaze. Pardon me my wrongs: the strength of my love
shall expiate them.”</p>

<p>You may judge of the effect of this sentimental oration.
The happy Chevalier lifted me up, and my pardon was
sealed on that very same ottoman where you and I once
sealed so gallantly, and in like fashion, our eternal rupture.</p>

<p>As we had six hours to pass together, and I had resolved
to make all this time equally delicious for him, I
moderated his transports, and brought an amiable coquetry
to replace tenderness. I do not think that I have ever
been at so great pains to please, nor that I have ever been
so pleased with myself. After supper, by turns childish
and reasonable, sensible and gay, even libertine at times,
it was my pleasure to look upon him as a sultan in the
heart of his seraglio, of which I was by turn the different
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>favourites. In fact, his repeated acts of homage, although
always received by the same woman, were ever received
by a different mistress.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp46" id="053" style="max-width: 31.6875em;">

</div>
<div class="sync">&#160;</div>
<p>Finally, at the approach of day, we were obliged to
separate; and whatever he might say, or even do, to prove
to me the contrary, he had as much need of separation
as he had little desire of it. At the moment when we
left the house, and for a last adieu, I took the key of this
abode of bliss, and giving it into his hands: “I had it
but for you,” said I; “it is right that you should be its
master. It is for him who sacrifices to have the disposition
of the temple.” By such a piece of adroitness, I anticipated
him from the reflexions which might have been suggested
to him, by the possession, always suspicious, of a <i>petite
maison</i>. I know him well enough to be sure that he will
never make use of it except for me; and if the whim
seized me to go there without him, I have a second key.
He would at all costs fix a day for return; but I love
him still too well, to care to exhaust him so soon. One
must not permit one’s self excesses, except with persons
whom one wishes soon to leave. He does not know that
himself; but happily for him, I have knowledge for two.</p>

<p>I perceive that it is three o’clock in the morning, and
that I have written a volume, with the intention but to
write a word. Such is the charm of constant friendship:
’tis on account of that, that you are always he whom
I love the best; but, in truth, the Chevalier pleases me
more.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="LETTER_THE_ELEVENTH">LETTER THE ELEVENTH
<br>
<small>THE PRÉSIDENTE DE TOURVEL TO MADAME DE VOLANGES</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">Your</span> severe letter would have alarmed me, Madame, if
happily I had not found here more causes for security
than you give me for being afraid. This redoubtable M.
de Valmont, who must be the terror of every woman,
seems to have laid down his murderous arms before coming
to this <i>château</i>. Far from forming any projects there, he
has not even advanced any pretensions: and the quality
of an amiable man, which even his enemies accord him,
almost disappears here, to be superseded by that of frank
good-nature.</p>

<p>It is apparently the country air which has brought
about this miracle. What I can assure you is that, being
constantly with me, even seeming to take pleasure in my
company, he has not let fall one word which resembles
love, not one of those phrases which all men permit
themselves, without having, like him, what is required
to justify them. He never compels one to that reserve
which every woman who respects herself is forced
to maintain nowadays, in order to repress the men
who encircle her. He knows how not to abuse the
gaiety which he inspires. He is perhaps somewhat of a
flatterer; but it is with so much delicacy, that he would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
accustom modesty itself to praise. In short, if I had a
brother, I should desire him to be such as M. de Valmont
reveals himself here. Perhaps, many women would ask a
more marked gallantry from him; and I admit that I owe
him infinite thanks for knowing how to judge me so well
as not to confound me with them.</p>

<p>Doubtless, this portrait differs mightily from that which
you send me: and in spite of that, neither need contradict
the other, if one compares the dates. He confesses
himself that he has committed many faults; and some
others will have been fathered on him. But I have met
few men who spoke of virtuous women with greater
respect, I might almost say enthusiasm. You teach me
that at least in this matter he is no deceiver. His conduct
towards Madame de Merteuil is a proof of this. He
talks much to us of her, and it is always with so much
praise, and with the air of so true an attachment, that I
believed, until I received your letter, that what he called
the friendship between the two was actually love. I
reproach myself for this hasty judgment, wherein I was
all the more wrong, in that he himself has often been
at the pains to justify her. I confess that I took for cunning
what was honest sincerity on his part. I do not know, but
it seems to me a man who is capable of so persistent a
friendship for a woman so estimable cannot be a libertine
beyond salvation. I am, for the rest, ignorant as
to whether we owe the quiet manner of life which he
leads here to any projects he cherishes in the vicinity,
as you assume. There are, indeed, certain amiable women
near us, but he rarely goes abroad, except in the morning,
and then he tells us that it is to shoot. It is true that
he rarely brings back any game; but he assures us that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
he is not a skilful sportsman. Moreover, what he may do
without causes me little anxiety; and if I desired to know,
it would only be in order to be convinced of your opinion
or to bring you back to mine.</p>

<p>As to your suggestion to me to endeavour to cut short
the stay which M. de Valmont proposes to make here, it
seems to me very difficult to dare to ask his aunt not to
have her nephew in her house, the more so in that she
is very fond of him. I promise you, however, but only
out of deference and not for any need, to seize any
opportunity of making this request, either to her or to
himself. As for myself, M. de Tourvel is aware of my
project of remaining here until his return, and he would
be astonished, and rightly so, at my frivolity, were I to
change my mind.</p>

<p>These, Madame, are my very lengthy explanations:
but I thought I owed it to truth to bear my testimony in
M. de Valmont’s favour; it seems to me he stood in
great need of it with you. I am none the less sensible of
the friendship which dictated your counsels. To that also
I am indebted for your obliging remarks to me on the
occasion of the delay as to your daughter’s marriage. I
thank you for them most sincerely: but however great the
pleasure which I promise myself in passing those moments
with you, I would sacrifice them with a good will to my
desire to know Mlle. de Volanges more speedily happy,
if, indeed, she could ever be more so than with a mother
so deserving of all her affection and respect. I share with
her those two sentiments which attach me to you, and I
pray you kindly to receive my assurance of them.</p>

<br><small>CÉCILE VOLANGES TO SOPHIE CARNAY</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="noin">I <span class="smcap">did</span> not write to you yesterday, my dear Sophie, but it
was not pleasure which was the cause; of that I can assure
you. Mamma was ill, and I did not leave her all day.
In the evening, when I retired, I had no heart for anything
at all, and I went to bed very quickly, to make sure
that the day was done; never have I passed a longer.
It is not that I do not love Mamma dearly; but I do
not know what it was. I was to have gone to the Opera
with Madame de Merteuil; the Chevalier Danceny was to
have been there. You know well that they are the two
persons whom I like best. When the hour arrived when
I should have been there, my heart was sore in spite of
me. I did not care for anything, and I cried, cried, without
being able to stop myself. Happily Mamma had gone to
bed, and could not see me. I am quite sure that the
Chevalier Danceny will have been sorry too, but he will
have been amused by the spectacle, and by everybody;
that’s very different.</p>

<p>Luckily, Mamma is better to-day, and Madame de
Merteuil is coming with somebody else and the Chevalier
Danceny; but she always comes very late, Madame de
Merteuil; and when one is so long all by one’s self, it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
is very tiresome. It is not yet eleven o’clock. It is true
that I must play on my harp; and then my toilette will
take me some time, for I want my hair to be done nicely
to-day. I think Mother Perpétue is right and that one
becomes a coquette as soon as one enters the world. I
have never had such a desire to look pretty as during
the last few days, and I find I am not as much so as I
thought; and then, by the side of women who use rouge,
one loses much. Madame de Merteuil, for instance; I
can see that all the men think her prettier than me: that
does not vex me much, because she is so fond of me;
and then she assures me that the Chevalier Danceny
thinks I am prettier than she. It is very nice of her to
have told me that! She even seemed to be pleased at it.
Well, that’s a thing I can’t understand! It’s because she
likes me so much! And he!... Oh, that gives me so
much pleasure! I think too that only to look at him
is enough to make one prettier. I should look at him
always, if I did not fear to meet his eyes: for every time
that that happens to me, it puts me out of countenance,
and seems as though it hurt me; but no matter!</p>

<p>Adieu, my dear friend: I am going to make my toilette.
I love you as dearly as ever.</p>

<br><small>THE VICOMTE DE VALMONT TO THE MARQUISE DE MERTEUIL</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">It</span> is very nice of you not to abandon me to my sad
fate. The life I lead here is really fatiguing, from the
excess of its repose and its insipid monotony. Reading
your letter and the details of your charming day, I was
tempted a score of times to invent some business, to
fly to your feet, and beg of you an infidelity, in my
favour, to your Chevalier, who, after all, does not merit
his happiness. Do you know that you have made me
jealous of him? Why talk to me of an eternal rupture?
I abjure that vow, uttered in a moment of frenzy: we
should not have been worthy to make it, had we meant
to keep it. Ah, that I might one day avenge myself, in
your arms, for the involuntary vexation which the happiness
of your Chevalier has caused me! I am indignant, I confess,
when I think that this man, without reasoning, without
giving himself the least trouble, but quite stupidly following
the instinct of his heart, should find a felicity to which I
cannot attain. Oh, I will trouble it!... Promise me
that I shall trouble it. You yourself, are you not humiliated?
You take the trouble to deceive him, and he is
happier than you. You believe he is in your chains! It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
is, indeed, you, who are in his. He sleeps tranquilly,
whilst you watch over his pleasures. What more would
his slave do?</p>

<p>Listen, my lovely friend: so long as you divide yourself
among many, I have not the least jealousy; I see then in
your lovers only the successors of Alexander, incapable of
preserving amongst them all that empire over which I
reigned alone. But that you should give yourself entirely
to one of them! That another man should exist as fortunate
as myself! I will not suffer it; do not hope that
I shall suffer it. Either take me back, or, at least, take
someone else; and do not betray, by an exclusive
caprice, the inviolate bond of friendship which we have
sworn.</p>

<p>It is quite enough, no doubt, that I should have to
complain of love. You see, I lend myself to your ideas,
and confess my errors. In fact, if to be in love is to be
unable to live without possessing the object of one’s
desire, to sacrifice to it one’s time, one’s pleasures, one’s
life, I am very really in love. I am no more advanced
for that. I should not even have anything at all to tell
you of in this matter, but for an incident which gives me
much food for reflexion, and as to which I know not yet
whether I must hope or fear.</p>

<p>You know my <i>chasseur</i>, a treasure of intrigue, and a
real valet of comedy: you can imagine that his instructions
bade him to fall in love with the waiting-maid, and make
the household drunk. The knave is more fortunate than
I: he has already succeeded. He has just discovered that
Madame de Tourvel has charged one of her people to
inform himself as to my behaviour, and even to follow
me in my morning expeditions, as far as he could without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
being observed. What is this woman’s pretension? Thus
then the most modest of them all yet dares do things
which we should hardly venture to permit ourselves. I
swear...! But before I think of avenging myself for
this feminine ruse, let us occupy ourselves over methods
of turning it to our advantage. Hitherto, these excursions
which are suspected have had no object; needs must I give
them one. This deserves all my attention, and I take leave
of you to ponder upon it. Farewell, my lovely friend.</p>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">Ah</span>, my Sophie, I have a heap of news! I ought not,
perhaps, to tell you: but I must talk to someone; it is
stronger than I! This Chevalier Danceny ... I am
so perturbed that I can hardly write: I do not know
where to begin. Ever since I related to you the sweet
evening<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> which I passed at Mamma’s, with him and
Madame de Merteuil, I have said no more about him to
you: it is because I did not want to speak of him to
anybody; but I was thinking of him constantly. Since
then he has grown so sad—oh, sad, sad!—that it gave me
pain; and when I asked him why, he answered that it
was not so; but I could well see that it <i>was</i>. Finally,
yesterday he was even sadder than ordinarily. This did
not prevent him from having the kindness to sing with
me as usual; but every time that he looked at me it
gripped my heart. When we had finished singing, he
went to shut up my harp in its case; and returning the
key to me, begged me to play again that evening when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
I was alone. I had no suspicion of anything at all; I
did not even want to play: but he begged me so earnestly
that I told him yes. He, certainly, had his motive. In
effect, when I had retired to my room and my waiting-maid
had gone, I went to get my harp. In the strings
I found a letter, simply folded, with no seal, and it was
from him. Ah, if you knew all he asks of me! Since I
have read his letter, I feel so much delight that I can
think of nothing else. I read it four times straight off,
and then shut it up in my desk. I knew it by heart;
and, when I was in bed, I repeated it so often that I
had no thought to sleep. As soon as I shut my eyes, I
saw him there; he told me himself all that I had just
read. I did not get to sleep till quite late; and, as soon
as I was awake (it was still quite early), I went to get
his letter and read it again at my ease. I carried it to
bed with me, and then I kissed it as if.... Perhaps I
did wrong to kiss a letter like that, but I could not check
myself.</p>

<p>At present, my dear friend, if I am very happy, I am
also much embarrassed; for, assuredly, I ought not to
reply to this letter. I know that I should not, and yet
he asks me to; and, if I do not reply, I am sure he will
be sad again. All the same, it is very unfortunate for
him! What do you advise me to do? But you can no
more tell than I. I have a great desire to speak of it to
Madame de Merteuil, who is so fond of me. I should
indeed like to console him; but I should not like to do
anything wrong. We are always recommended to cherish
a kind heart! and then they forbid us to follow its inspiration,
directly there is question of a man! That is not
just either. Is not a man our neighbour as much as a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
woman, if not more so? For, after all, has not one one’s
father as well as one’s mother, one’s brother as well
as one’s sister? The husband is still something extra.
Nevertheless, if I were to do something which was not
right, perhaps M. Danceny himself would no longer have
a good opinion of me! Oh, rather than that, I would
sooner see him sad; and then, besides, I shall always have
time enough. Because he wrote yesterday, I am not
obliged to write to-day: I shall be sure to see Madame
de Merteuil this evening, and, if I have the courage, I
will tell her all. If I only do what she tells me, I shall
have nothing to reproach myself with. And then, perhaps,
she will tell me that I may answer him <i>a little</i>, so that
he need not be so sad! Oh, I am in great trouble!</p>

<p>Farewell, my dear friend; tell me, all the same, what
you think.</p>

<br><small>THE CHEVALIER DANCENY TO CÉCILE VOLANGES</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">Before</span> succumbing, Mademoiselle, to the pleasure, or,
shall I say, the necessity of writing to you, I commence
by imploring you to hear me. I feel that, to be bold
enough to declare my sentiments, I have need of indulgence;
did I but wish to justify them, it would be useless
to me. What am I about to do, after all, save to show
you your handiwork? And what have I to tell you, that
my eyes, my embarrassment, my conduct and even my
silence have not told you already? And why should you
take offence at a sentiment to which you have given
birth? Emanating from you, it is worthy to be offered to
you; if it is ardent as my soul, it is pure as your own.
Shall it be a crime to have known how to appreciate your
charming face, your seductive talents, your enchanting
graces, and that touching candour which adds inestimable
value to qualities already so precious? No, without a
doubt: but without being guilty, one may be unhappy;
and that is the fate which awaits me if you refuse to
accept my homage. It is the first that my heart has
offered. But for you, I should have been, not happy, but
tranquil. I have seen you, repose has fled far away from
me, and my happiness is insecure. Yet you are surprised<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
at my sadness; you ask me its cause: sometimes, I have
even thought to see that it affected you. Ah, speak but
a word and my felicity will be your handiwork! But, before
you pronounce it, remember that one word can also fill the
cup of my misery. Be then the arbiter of my destiny.
Through you I am to be eternally happy or wretched.
In what dearer hands can I commit an interest of such
importance?</p>

<p>I shall end as I have begun, by imploring your indulgence.
I have begged you to hear me; I will dare
more, I will pray you to reply to me. A refusal would
lead me to think that you were offended and my heart is
a witness that my respect is equal to my love.</p>

<p>P.S. You can make use, to send a reply, of the same
method which I employed to bring this letter into your
hands; it seems to me as convenient as it is secure.</p>

<br><small>CÉCILE VOLANGES TO SOPHIE CARNAY</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">What</span>, Sophie! You blame me in advance for what I
am about to do! I had already enough anxiety, and
here you are increasing it. Clearly, you say, I ought not
to answer. You speak with great confidence; and besides,
you do not know exactly how things are: you are not
here to see. I am sure that, were you in my place, you
would act like me. Assuredly, as a general rule, one
ought not to reply; and you can see from my letter of
yesterday that I did not want to either: but the thing is, I do
not think anyone has <i>ever</i> found herself in quite my case.</p>

<p>And still to be obliged to take my decision all unaided!
Madame de Merteuil, whom I counted on seeing yesterday
evening, did not come. Everything conspires against
me: it is through her that I know him! It is almost
always with her that I have seen him, that <i>I</i> have
spoken to him. It is not that I have any grudge against
her; but she leaves me just in the embarrassing moment.
Oh, I am greatly to be pitied!</p>

<p>Imagine! He came here yesterday just as he used to.
I was so confused that I dared not look at him. He
could not speak to me, because Mamma was there. I
quite expected that he would be grieved, when he should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
find that I had not written to him. I did not know what
face to wear. A moment later he asked me if I should
like him to bring me my harp. My heart beat so quick,
that it was as much as I could do to answer yes. When
he came back, it was even worse. I only looked at him
for a second. He—he did not look at me, but he had
such a look that one would have thought him ill. It
made me very unhappy. He began to tune my harp,
and afterwards, coming close to me, he said, “Ah, Mademoiselle!”....
He only said these two words; but it was
with such an accent that I was quite overwhelmed. I
struck the first chords on my harp without knowing what I
was doing. Mamma asked me if we were not going to sing.
He excused himself, saying that he was not feeling well,
and I, who had no excuse—I had to sing. I could have
wished that I had never had a voice. I chose purposely
an air which I did not know; for I was quite sure that I
could not sing anything, and was afraid that something
would be noticed. Luckily, there came a visit, and as soon
as I heard the carriage wheels, I stopped, and begged
him to take away my harp. I was very much afraid lest
he should leave at the same time; but he came back.</p>

<p>Whilst Mamma and the lady who had arrived were
talking together, I wanted to look at him again for one
instant. I met his eyes, and it was impossible for me to
turn away my own. A moment later, I saw the tears
rise, and he was obliged to turn away in order not to be
observed. For an instant I could no longer hold myself
in; I felt that I too should weep. I went out, and at
once wrote in pencil, on a scrap of paper: “Do not be
so sad, I implore you; I promise to give you a reply.”
Surely, you cannot see any harm in that, and then it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
was stronger than I. I put my paper in the strings of my
harp, where his letter had been, and returned to the <i>salon</i>.
I felt more calm.</p>

<p>It seemed to me very long until the lady went away.
Luckily, she had more visits to pay; she went away shortly
afterwards. As soon as she was gone, I said that I
wanted to have my harp again, and begged him to go
and fetch it. I saw from his expression that he suspected
nothing. But, on his return, oh, how pleased he was!
As he set down my harp in front of me, he placed himself
in such a position that Mamma could not see, and
he took my hand, which he squeezed ... but, in such a
way! ... it was only for a moment: but I could not tell
you the pleasure which it gave me. However, I withdrew
it; so I have nothing for which to reproach myself.</p>

<p>And now, my dear friend, you must see that I cannot
abstain from writing to him, since I have given my
promise; and then I am not going to give him any
more pain; for I suffer more than he does. If it were a
question of doing anything wrong, I should certainly
not do it. But what harm can there be in writing,
especially when it is to save somebody from being
unhappy? What embarrasses me is that I do not know
how to write my letter: but he will surely feel that it is
not my fault; and then I am certain that as long as it
only comes from me, it will give him pleasure.</p>

<p>Adieu, my dear friend. If you think that I am wrong,
tell me; but I do not think so. The nearer the moment
of writing to him comes, the more does my heart beat:
more than you can conceive. I must do it, however,
since I have promised. Adieu.</p>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">You</span> were so sad yesterday, Monsieur, and that made me
so sorry, that I went so far as to promise to reply to the
letter which you wrote me. I none the less feel to-day
that I ought not to do this: however, as I have promised,
I do not wish to break my word, and that must prove
how much friendship I feel for you. Now that you know
that, I hope you will not ask me to write to you again.
I hope also that you will tell nobody that I have written
to you, because I should be certainly blamed, and that
might cause me a great deal of pain. I hope, above all,
that you yourself will not form a bad opinion of me,
which would grieve me more than anything. I can give
you every assurance that I would not have done as
much to anyone except yourself. I should be very glad
if you would do me a favour in your turn, and be less
sad than you were: it takes away all the pleasure that
I feel in seeing you. You see, Monsieur, I speak to you
very sincerely. I ask nothing better than that I may
always keep your friendship; but I beg of you do not
write to me again.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="LETTER_THE_TWENTIETH">LETTER THE TWENTIETH

<br><small>THE MARQUISE DE MERTEUIL TO THE VICOMTE DE VALMONT</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">Ah</span>, wretch, so you flatter me, for fear that I shall
make a mock of you! Come, I pardon you: you
write me such a heap of nonsense that I must even forgive
you the virtue in which you are kept by your Présidente.
I do not think my Chevalier would show as
much indulgence as I do; he would not be the man to
approve the renewal of our contract, or to find anything
amusing in your mad idea. I have laughed mightily over
it, however, and was really vexed that I had to laugh over
it by myself. If you had been there, I know not whither
this merriment might not have led us; but I have had
time for reflexion, and am armed with severity. I do not
say that I refuse for ever; but I postpone, and I am right
to do so. I should bring my vanity with me, and once
wounded at the game, one knows not where one stops.
I should be the woman to enslave you again, to make
you forget your Présidente; and if I—unworthy I—were to
disgust you with virtue, consider the scandal! To avoid
these dangers, here are my conditions:</p>

<p>As soon as you have had your lovely bigot, as soon as
you can furnish me with the proof, come to me and I
am yours. But you cannot be ignorant that, in affairs of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
importance, only written proofs are admitted. By this
arrangement, on one part, I shall become a recompense
instead of being a consolation, and that notion likes me
better: on the other hand, your success will have added
piquancy by being itself a means to an infidelity. Come
then, come as soon as possible, and bring me the gage of
your triumph; like those valiant knights of ours, who came
to lay at their ladies’ feet the brilliant fruits of their
victory. Seriously, I am curious to know what a prude
can write after such a moment, and what veil she casts
over her language, after having discarded any from her
person. It is for you to say whether I price myself too
high; but I forewarn you that there is no abatement.
Till then, my dear Vicomte, you will find it good that I
remain faithful to my Chevalier and amuse myself by
making him happy, in spite of the slight annoyance this
may cause you.</p>

<p>However, if my morals were less severe, I think you
would have, at this moment, a dangerous rival: the little
Volanges girl. I am bewitched by this child: it is a real
passion. Unless I be deceived, she will become one of
our most fashionable women. I see her little heart developing,
and it is a ravishing spectacle. She already loves
her Danceny with ardour; but she knows nothing about
it yet. He himself, although greatly in love, has still the
timidity of his age, and dares not as yet tell her too
much about it. The two of them are united in adoring
me. The little one especially has a mighty desire to confide
her secret to me. A few days ago, particularly, I saw her
really oppressed, and should have done her a great service
by assisting her a little: but I do not forget that she is
a child, and I should not like to compromise myself.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
Danceny has spoken to me somewhat more clearly; but
with him my course is resolved; I refuse to hear him.
As to the little one, I am often tempted to make her my
pupil; it is a service that I would fain render Gercourt.
He leaves me the time, since he is to stay in Corsica
until the month of October. I have a notion to make use
of that time, and that we will give him a fully formed
woman, instead of his innocent school-girl. In effect, what
must be the insolent sense of security of this man, that
he dare sleep in comfort, whilst a woman who has to
complain of him has not yet been avenged? Believe me,
if the child were here at this moment, I do not know
what I would not say to her.</p>

<p>Adieu, Vicomte; good-night, and success to you: but
do, for God’s sake, make progress. Bethink you that, if you
do not have this woman, the others will blush for having
taken you.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="LETTER_THE_TWENTY-FIRST">LETTER THE TWENTY-FIRST

<br><small>THE VICOMTE DE VALMONT TO THE MARQUISE DE MERTEUIL</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">At</span> last, my lovely friend, I have taken a step forward:
a really great step, and one which, if it has not taken me
to my goal, has at least let me know that I am on the
right road, and dispelled the fear I was in, that I was
lost. I have at last declared my love; and although the
most obstinate silence had been maintained, I have
obtained a reply that is, perhaps, the least equivocal and
the most flattering: but let us not anticipate events, let
us begin further back.</p>

<p>You will remember that a watch was set upon my
movements. Well, I resolved that this scandalous means
should turn to public edification; and this is what I did.
I charged my confidant with the task of finding me some
poor wretch in the neighbourhood who was in need of
succour. This commission was not difficult to fulfil. Yesterday
afternoon, he gave me the information that they were
going to seize to-day, in the morning, the goods of a
whole family who could not pay their taxes. I assured myself
that there was no girl or woman amongst this household
whose age or face might render my action suspicious; and,
when I was well informed, I declared at supper my intention<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
of going after game in the morning. Here I must render
justice to my Présidente; doubtless she felt a certain remorse
at the orders which she had given; and, not having
the strength to vanquish her curiosity, she had at least
enough to oppose my desire. It was going to be excessively
hot; I ran the risk of making myself ill; I should kill
nothing, and tire myself to no purpose; and during all
this dialogue, her eyes, which spoke, perhaps, better than
she wished, let me see quite sufficiently that she desired
me to take these bad reasons for good. I was careful
not to surrender, as you may believe, and I even resisted
a little diatribe against sportsmen and sport and a little
cloud of ill-humour which obscured, during all the evening,
that celestial brow. I feared for a moment that her orders
had been revoked, and that her delicacy might hinder me.
I did not calculate on the strength of a woman’s curiosity;
and so was deceived. My <i>chasseur</i> reassured me the same
evening, and I went satisfied to bed.</p>

<p>At daybreak I rose and started off. Barely fifty yards
from the <i>château</i>, I perceived the spy who was to follow
me. I started after the game, and walked across country
to the village whither I wished to make, with no other
pleasure on the road than to give a run to the rogue who
followed me, and who, not daring to quit the road, often
had to cover, at full speed, a three times greater distance
than mine. By dint of exercising him, I was excessively
hot myself, and I sat down at the foot of a tree. He
had the insolence to steal behind a bush, not twenty paces
from me, and to sit down as well! I was tempted for a
moment to fire my gun at him, which, although it only
contained small shot, would have given him a sufficient
lesson as to the dangers of curiosity: luckily for him, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
remembered that he was useful and even necessary to my
projects; this reflexion saved him.</p>

<p>However, I reach the village; I see the commotion; I
step forward; I question somebody; the facts are related.
I have the collector called to me; and, yielding to my
generous compassion, I pay nobly fifty-six livres, for lack
of which five persons were to be left to straw and their
despair. After this simple action, you cannot imagine
what a crowd of benedictions echoed round me from the
witnesses of the scene! What tears of gratitude poured
from the eyes of the aged head of the family, and
embellished his patriarchal face, which, a moment before,
had been rendered really hideous by the savage marks of
despair! I was watching this spectacle, when another peasant,
younger, who led a woman and two children by the
hands, advanced to me with hasty steps and said to them,
“Let us all fall at the feet of this image of God;” and at
the same instant I was surrounded by the family, prostrate
at my knees. I will confess my weakness: my eyes were
moistened by tears, and I felt an involuntary but delicious
emotion. I am astonished at the pleasure one experiences
in doing good; and I should be tempted to believe that
what we call virtuous people have not so much merit as
they lead us to suppose. However that may be, I found
it just to pay these poor people for the pleasure which
they had given me. I had brought ten louis with me,
and I gave them these. The acknowledgments began
again, but they were not pathetic to the same degree:
necessity had produced the great, the true effect; the rest
was but a simple expression of gratitude and astonishment
at superfluous gifts.</p>

</div>
<div class="sync">&#160;</div>
<p>However, in the midst of the loquacious benedictions of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>this family, I was by no means unlike the hero of a drama,
in the scene of the <i>dénouement</i>. Above all, you will remark
the faithful spy was also in this crowd. My purpose
was fulfilled: I disengaged myself from them all, and regained
the <i>château</i>. On further consideration, I congratulated
myself on my inventive genius. This woman
is, doubtless, well worth all the pains I take; they will one
day be my titles with her; and having, in some sort, as
it were, paid in advance, I shall have the right to dispose
of her, according to my fantasy, without having any cause
to reproach myself.</p>

<p>I forgot to tell you that, to turn everything to profit,
I asked these good people to pray for the success of my
projects. You shall see whether their prayers have not
been already in part hearkened to.... But they come to
tell me that supper is ready, and it would be too late to
dispatch this letter, if I waited to end it after rising from
table. “To be continued,” therefore, “in our next.”
I am sorry, for the sequel is the finest part. Adieu,
my lovely friend. You steal from me a moment of the
pleasure of seeing her.</p>

<br><small>THE PRÉSIDENTE DE TOURVEL TO MADAME DE VOLANGES</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">You</span> will, doubtless, be well pleased, Madame, to hear of
a trait in M. de Valmont which is in great contrast to
all those under which you have represented him to me.
It is so painful to have to think unfavourably of anybody,
so grievous to find only vices in people who should
possess all the qualities necessary to make virtue lovable!
Moreover, you love so well to be indulgent that, were it only
to oblige you, I must give you a reason for reconsidering
your too harsh judgment. M. de Valmont seems to
me entitled to hope for this favour, I might almost say
this justice; and this is on what I base my opinion.</p>

<p>This morning he made one of those excursions which
might lead one to believe in some project on his part,
in the vicinity, just as the idea came to you of one;
an idea which I accuse myself of having entertained
with too much precipitation. Luckily for him, and above
all luckily for us, since we are thus saved from being
unjust, one of my men happened to be going in the
same direction<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> and it is from this source that my
reprehensible but fortunate curiosity was satisfied. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
related to us that M. de Valmont, having found an
unfortunate family in the village of —— whose goods were
being sold because they were unable to pay their taxes,
not only hastened to pay the debt of these poor people,
but even added to this gift a considerable sum of money.
My servant was a witness of this virtuous action; and he
related to me in addition that the peasants, talking
amongst themselves and with him, had said that a
servant, whom they described, and who is believed by
mine to be that of M. de Valmont, had sought information
yesterday as to any of the inhabitants of the village who
might be in need of help. If that be so, it was not
merely a passing feeling of compassion, suggested by the
opportunity: it was the deliberate project of doing good;
it was a search for the chance of being benevolent; it
was the fairest virtue of the most noble souls: but be it
chance or design, it is none the less a laudable and
generous action, the mere recital of which moved me to
tears. I will add more, and still from a sense of justice,
that when I spoke to him of this action, which he had
never mentioned, he began by excusing himself, and had
the air of attaching so little importance to it, that the
merit of it was enhanced by his modesty.</p>

<p>After that, tell me, my esteemed friend, if M. de Valmont
is indeed an irreclaimable libertine? If he can be no more
than that and yet behave so, what is left for honest folk?
What! are the wicked to share with the good the sacred
joy of charity? Would God permit that a virtuous family
should receive from the hands of a villain succour for
which they render thanks to Divine Providence, and could
it please Him to hear pure lips bestow their blessings upon
a reprobate? No! I prefer to hold that errors, long as they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
may have lasted, do not endure for ever; and I cannot
think that he who does good can be the enemy of virtue.
M. de Valmont is perhaps only one more instance of the
danger of associations. I remain of this opinion which
pleases me. If, on one side, it may serve to justify him
in your opinion, on the other, it renders more and more
precious to me the tender friendship which unites me to
you for life.</p>

<p>I have the honour to be, etc.</p>

<p>P.S. Madame de Rosemonde and I are going this
moment to see for ourselves this worthy and unfortunate
family, and to unite our tardy aid to that of M. de Valmont.
We shall take him with us. We shall at least
give these good people the pleasure of seeing their benefactor:
that is, I believe, all he has left for us to do.</p>

<br><small>THE VICOMTE DE VALMONT TO THE MARQUISE DE MERTEUIL</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="noin">I <span class="smcap">left</span> off at my return to the <i>château</i>: I resume my
tale.</p>

<p>I had only time to make a hurried toilette, ere I repaired
to the drawing-room, where my beauty was working
at her tapestry, whilst the <i>curé</i> of the place was
reading the gazette to my old aunt. I went and took
my seat by the frame. Glances sweeter than were
customary, and almost caressing, enabled me soon to
divine that the servant had already given an account of
his mission. Indeed, the dear, inquisitive lady could no
longer keep the secret which she had acquired; and
without fear of interrupting a venerable pastor, whose
recital indeed resembled a sermon: “I too have a piece
of news to recite,” said she; and suddenly related my
adventure, with an exactitude which did honour to the
intelligence of her historian. You may conceive what play I
made with my modesty: but who can stop a woman, when
she praises the man whom, without knowing it, she loves? I
decided therefore to let her have her head. One would have
thought she was making the panegyric of a saint. All
this time I was observing, not without hope, all the promises
of love in her animated gaze; her gesture, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
had become more lively; and, above all, her voice, which,
by its already perceptible alteration, betrayed the emotion
of her soul. She had hardly finished speaking when:
“Come, my nephew,” said Madame de Rosemonde to me,
“come and let me embrace you.” I felt at once that the
pretty preacher could not prevent herself from being
embraced in her turn. However, she wished to fly; but
she was soon in my arms, and, so far from having the
strength to resist, she had scarcely sufficient to maintain
herself. The more I observe this woman, the more desirable
she appears to me. She hastened to return to her
frame, and to everybody had the appearance of resuming
her tapestry. But I saw well that her trembling hand
prevented her from continuing her work.</p>

<p>After dinner, the ladies insisted on going to see the
unfortunates whom I had so piously succoured; I accompanied
them. I spare you the tedium of this second
scene of gratitude and praise. My heart, impelled by a
delicious recollection, hurries on the moment for return
to the <i>château</i>. On the way, my fair Présidente, more
pensive than is her wont, said never a word. Occupied
as I was in seeking the means of profiting by the effect
which the episode of the day had produced, I maintained
the same silence. Madame de Rosemonde was the only
one to speak, and obtained from us but scant and few
replies. We must have bored her; that was my intention,
and it succeeded. Thus, on stepping from the carriage, she
passed into her apartment and left my fair one and myself
<i>tête-à-tête</i>, in a dimly lighted room—a sweet obscurity
which emboldens timid love.</p>

<p>I had not to be at the pains to lead the conversation
into the channel which I wished. The fervour of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
amiable preacheress served me better than any skill of
my own.</p>

<p>“When one is capable of doing good,” said she, letting
her sweet gaze rest on me, “how can one pass one’s life
in doing ill?”</p>

<p>“I do not deserve, either that praise or that censure,”
said I, “and I cannot imagine how you, who have so
clear a wit, have not yet divined me. Though my confidence
may damage me in your eyes, you are far too
worthy of it that I should be able to refuse it. You will
find the key to my conduct in my character, which is
unhappily far too easy-going. Surrounded by persons of
no morality, I have imitated their vices; I have perhaps
made it a point of vanity to surpass them. In the same way,
attracted here by the example of virtue, without ever hoping
to come up to you, I have, at least, endeavoured to
imitate you. Ah, perhaps the action for which you praise
me to-day would lose all value in your eyes if you knew
its true motive!” (You see, my fair friend, how near the truth
I touched.) “It is not to myself,” I went on, “that
these unfortunates owe their rescue. Where you think
you see a praiseworthy action, I did but seek a means to
please. I was nothing else, since I must say it, but the
weak agent of the divinity whom I adore.” (Here she
would have interrupted me, but I did not give her time.)
“At this very moment even,” I added, “my secret only
escapes from my weakness. I had vowed that I would
be silent before you; I made it my happiness to render
to your virtues as much as to your charms a pure homage
of which you should always remain ignorant; but incapable of
deception, when I have before my eyes the example of
candour, I shall not have to reproach myself to you with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
guilty dissimulation. Do not believe that I insult you
by entertaining any criminal hope. I shall be miserable,
I know; but my sufferings will be dear to me: they
will prove to me the immensity of my love; it is at your
feet, it is on your bosom that I will cast down my woes.
There shall I draw the strength to suffer anew; there
shall I find compassionate bounty, and I shall deem myself
consoled because you will have pitied me. Oh, you
whom I adore! hearken to me, pity me, succour me!”</p>

<p>By this time I was at her feet, and I pressed her hands
in mine; but she suddenly disengaged them and, folding
them over her eyes, cried with an expression of despair,
“Oh, wretched me!” then burst into tears. Luckily I was
exalted to such a degree that I also wept; and, seizing
her hands again, I bathed them with my tears. This precaution
was most necessary; for she was so full of her grief
that she would not have perceived my own, had I not
taken this means of informing her. I moreover gained
the privilege of considering at my leisure that charming
face, yet more embellished by the potent charm of her
tears. My head grew hot, and so little was I master of
myself that I was tempted to profit by that moment.</p>

<p>What is this weakness of ours? of what avail is the
force of circumstances if, forgetting my own projects, I
risked losing, by a premature triumph, the charms of a long
battle and the details of a painful defeat; if, seduced by the
desires of youth, I thought of exposing the conqueror of
Madame de Tourvel to the pain of plucking, for the fruit of
victory, but the insipid consolation of having had one woman
more? Ah, let her surrender, but let her first fight; let her,
without having strength to conquer, have enough to resist;
let her relish at her leisure the sentiment of her weakness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
and be constrained to confess her defeat! Let us leave it
to the obscure poacher to kill at a bound the stag he has
surprised; your true hunter will give it a run. Is not
this project of mine sublime? Yet perhaps I should be
now regretting that I had not followed it, had not chance
come to the rescue of my prudence.</p>

<p>We heard a noise. Someone was coming to the drawing-room.
Madame de Tourvel, in alarm, rose precipitately,
seized one of the candles, and left the room. I could not
but let her go. It was only one of the servants. As
soon as I was assured of this, I followed her. I had hardly
gone a few paces, before, whether that she had recognized
me, or for some vague sentiment of terror, she quickened
her steps, and flung herself into, rather than entered, her
chamber, the door of which she closed behind her. I
went after her; but the door was locked inside. I was careful
not to knock; that would have been to give her the chance
of a too easy resistance. I had the good and simple
idea of peeping through the key-hole, and I saw this
adorable woman on her knees, bathed with tears, and
fervently praying. What God did she dare invoke? Is
there one potent enough to resist love? In vain, henceforward,
will she invoke extraneous aid! ’Tis I who will
order her destiny.</p>

<p>Thinking I had done enough for one day, I too withdrew
to my own room, and started to write to you. I
hoped to see her again at supper; but she had given out
that she was indisposed, and had gone to bed. Madame
de Rosemonde wished to go up to her; but the cunning
invalid alleged a headache which prevented her from
seeing anybody. You may guess that after supper the
interval was short, and that I too had my headache. Withdrawing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
to my room, I wrote a long letter to complain of
this severity, and went to bed with the intention of delivering
it to her this morning. I slept badly, as you can see by
the date of this letter. I rose and re-read my epistle. I
discovered that I had not been sufficiently restrained, had
exhibited less love than ardour. It must be written again,
but in a calmer mood.</p>

<p>I see the day break, and I hope the freshness which
accompanies it will bring me sleep. I am going to return
to my bed; and, whatever may be the power of this
woman over me, I promise you never to be so occupied
with her as to lack time to think much of you. Adieu,
my lovely friend!</p>

<br><small>THE VICOMTE DE VALMONT TO THE PRÉSIDENTE DE TOURVEL</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">Ah</span>, Madame, deign in pity to calm the trouble of my
soul, deign to tell me what I am to hope or fear. Cast
between the extremes of happiness and misfortune,
uncertainty is a cruel torment. Why did I speak to
you? Why did I not know how to resist the imperious
charm which betrayed my thoughts to you? Content
to adore you in silence, I had at least the consolation
of my love; and this pure sentiment, untroubled then
by the image of your grief, sufficed for my felicity;
but that source of happiness has become my despair,
since I saw your tears flow, since I heard that cruel <i>Ah,
wretched me!</i></p>

<p>Madame, those words will echo long within my heart.
By what fatality can the sweetest of the sentiments
inspire nothing but terror? What then is this fear? Ah,
it is not that of reciprocation: your heart, which I have
misunderstood, is not made for love; mine, which you
calumniate unceasingly is the only one which is disturbed:
yours is even pitiless. If it were not so, you would not
have refused a word of consolation to the wretch who
told you of his sufferings; you would not have withdrawn
yourself from his sight, when he has no other pleasure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
than that of seeing you; you would not have played a cruel
game with his anxiety by letting him be told that you
were ill, without permitting him to go and inform himself
of your health; you would have felt that the same night
which did but mean for you twelve hours of repose would
be for him a century of pain.</p>

<p>For what cause, tell me, have I deserved this intolerable
severity? I do not fear to take you for my judge:
what have I done, then, but yield to an involuntary
sentiment, inspired by beauty and justified by virtue,
always restrained by respect, the innocent avowal of
which was the effect of trust and not of hope? Will you
betray that trust, which you yourself seemed to permit me,
and to which I yielded myself without reserve? No, I
cannot believe that: it would be to imply a fault in you,
and my heart revolts at the bare idea of detecting one.
I withdraw my reproaches; write them I can, but think
them never! Ah, let me believe you perfect; it is the
one pleasure which is left me! Prove to me that you
are so by granting me your generous aid. What poor
wretch have you ever helped who was in so much need
as I? Do not abandon me to the frenzy in which you
have plunged me: lend me your reason since you have
ravished mine; after having corrected me, give me light
to complete your work.</p>

<p>I would not deceive you; you will never succeed in
subduing my love; but you shall teach me to moderate
it: by guiding my conduct, by dictating my speech, you
will save me, at least, from the dire misfortune of displeasing
you. Dispel above all that dreadful fear; tell me that
you forgive me, that you pity me; assure me of your
indulgence. You will never have as much as I should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
desire in you; but I invoke that of which I have need:
will you refuse it me?</p>

<p>Adieu, Madame; be kind enough to receive the homage
of my sentiments; it hinders not that of my respect.</p>

<br><small>THE VICOMTE DE VALMONT TO THE MARQUISE DE MERTEUIL</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">This</span> is yesterday’s bulletin. At eleven o’clock I visited
Madame de Rosemonde, and, under her auspices, I was
introduced into the presence of the pretended invalid, who
was still in her bed. Her eyes looked very worn; I hope
she slept as badly as I did. I seized a moment when
Madame de Rosemonde had turned away to deliver my
letter: it was refused; but I left it on the bed, and went decorously
to the side of my old aunt’s arm-chair. She wished to
be near <i>her dear child</i>. It was necessary to conceal the letter
to avoid scandal. The invalid was artless enough to say that
she thought she had a little fever. Madame de Rosemonde
persuaded me to feel her pulse, vaunting mightily my
knowledge of medicine. My beauty then had the double
vexation of being forced to give me her hand, and of
feeling that her little falsehood was to be discovered.
I took her hand, which I pressed in one of mine,
whilst, with the other, I ran over her fresh and rounded
arm. The naughty creature made no response, which impelled
me to say, as I withdrew, “There is not even the
slightest symptom.” I suspected that her gaze would be
severe, and, to punish her, I refused to meet it: a moment
later she said that she wished to rise, and we left her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
alone. She appeared at dinner, which was a sombre
one; she gave out that she would not take a walk, which
was as much as to tell me that I should have no opportunity
of conversing with her. I was well aware that,
at this point, I must put in a sigh and a mournful look;
no doubt she was waiting for that, for it was the one
moment of the day when I succeeded in meeting her
eyes. Virtuous as she is, she has her little ruses like
another. I found a moment to ask of her “if she had had
the kindness to inform me of my fate,” and I was somewhat
astonished when she answered, “Yes, Monsieur, I have
written to you.” I was mighty anxious to have this letter,
but whether it were a ruse again, or for awkwardness, or
shyness, she did not give it to me till the evening,
when she was retiring to her apartment. I send
it you, as well as the first draft of mine; read and judge;
see with what signal falsity she says that she feels no love,
when I am sure of the contrary; and then she will complain
if I deceive her afterwards, when she does not fear
to deceive me before! My lovely friend, the cleverest
of men can do no more than keep on a level with the
truest woman. I must needs, however, feign to believe
all this nonsense, and weary myself with despair, because
it pleases Madame to play at severity! It is hard not to
be revenged on such baseness! Ah, patience!... But
adieu. I have still much to write. By the way, return
me the letter of the fair barbarian; it might happen
later that she would expect one to attach a value to
those wretched sheets, and one must be in order.</p>

<p>I say nothing to you of the little Volanges; we will talk
of her at an early day.</p>

<br><small>THE PRÉSIDENTE DE TOURVEL TO THE VICOMTE DE VALMONT</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">Assuredly</span>, Monsieur, you would never have received any
letter from me, did not my foolish conduct of yesterday
evening compel me to-day to have an explanation with
you. Yes, I wept, I confess it: perhaps, too, the
words which you are so careful to quote to me did
escape me; tears and words, you remarked everything;
I must then explain to you everything.</p>

<p>Accustomed to inspire only honourable sentiments, to
hear only conversation to which I can listen without a
blush, and consequently to enjoy a feeling of security
which I venture to say I deserve, I know not how either
to dissimulate or to combat the impressions I receive.
The astonishment and embarrassment into which your
conduct threw me; a fear, I know not of what, inspired
by a situation which should never have been thrust upon
me; perhaps, even the revolting idea of seeing myself
confounded with the women whom you despise, and
treated as lightly as they are: all these causes in conjunction
provoked my tears, and may have made me
say, I think with reason, that I was wretched. This
expression, which you think so strong, would certainly have
been far too weak, if my tears and utterance had another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
motive; if, instead of disapproving sentiments which must
need offend me, I could have feared lest I should share
them.</p>

<p>No, Monsieur, I have not that fear; if I had, I would
fly a hundred leagues away from you, I would go and
weep in a desert at the misfortune of having known you.
Perhaps even, in spite of the certainty in which I am
of not loving you, of never loving you, perhaps I should
have done better to follow the counsels of my friends, and
forbid you to approach me.</p>

<p>I believed, and it is my sole error, I believed that you
would respect a virtuous woman, who asked nothing better
than to find you so and to do you justice; who already
was defending you, whilst you were outraging her with your
criminal avowals. You do not know me; no, Monsieur,
you do not know me. Otherwise you would not have
thought to make a right out of your error: because you
had made proposals to me which I ought not to hear,
you would not have thought yourself authorized to write
me a letter which I ought not to read: and you ask me
<i>to guide your conduct, to dictate to you your speech</i>!
Very well, Monsieur, silence and forgetfulness, those are
the counsels which it becomes me to give you, as it will
you to follow them; then you will indeed have rights to my
indulgence: it will only rest with you to obtain even
my gratitude.... But no, I will not address a request
to a man who has not respected me; I will give no mark
of confidence to a man who has abused my security. You
force me to fear, perhaps to hate you: I did not want
to; I wished to see in you naught else than the
nephew of my most respected friend; I opposed the
voice of friendship to the public voice which accused<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
you. You have destroyed it all; and I foresee, you will
not want to repair it.</p>

<p>I am anxious, Monsieur, to make it clear to you that
your sentiments offend me; that their avowal is an outrage
to me; and, above all, that, so far from my coming one
day to share them, you would force me to refuse ever
again to see you, if you do not impose on yourself, as to
this subject, the silence which it seems to me I have the
right to expect and even to demand from you. I enclose
in this letter that which you have written to me, and I beg
that you will similarly return me this: I should be sincerely
grieved if any trace remained of an incident which ought
never to have occurred.</p>

<p>I have the honour to be, etc.</p>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">Lord</span>! how good you are, Madame! how well you understood
that it would be easier to me to write to you than
to speak! What I have to tell you, too, is very difficult;
but is it not true that you are my friend? Oh yes, my
very dear friend! I am going to try not to be afraid; and
then, I have so much need of you, of your counsels! I
am so very grieved, it seems to me that everybody guesses
my thoughts; and, especially when he is there, I blush as
soon as anyone looks at me. Yesterday, when you saw
me crying, it was because I wished to speak to you, and
then, I do not know what prevented me; and, when you
asked me what was the matter, my tears flowed in spite of
myself. I could not have said a single word. But for
you, Mamma would have noticed it; and what would
have become of me then? That is how I pass my life,
especially since four days ago!</p>

<p>It was on that day, Madame, yes, I am going to tell
you, it was on that day that M. le Chevalier Danceny
wrote to me: oh, I assure you that when I found his
letter, I did not know at all what it was: but, not to
tell a falsehood, I cannot tell you that I did not take
a great deal of pleasure in reading it; you see, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
would sooner have sorrow all my life than that he should not
have written it. But I knew well that I ought not to
tell him that, and I can even assure you that I told him
I was vexed at it: but he said that it was stronger than
himself, and I quite believe it; for I had resolved not to
answer him, and yet I could not help myself. Oh,
I have only written to him once, and even that was
partly to tell him not to write to me again: but, in spite
of that, he goes on writing to me; and, as I do not answer
him, I see quite well that he is sad, and that pains me
more still: so much that I no longer know what to do,
nor what will happen, and I am much to be pitied.</p>

<p>Tell me, I beg you, Madame, would it be very
wrong to reply to him from time to time? Only until he
has been able to resolve not to write to me any more
himself, and to stay as we were before: for, as for me,
if this continues, I do not know what will happen to me.
See, in reading his last letter, I cried as though I should
never have done; and I am very sure that if I do not
answer him again, it will cause us a great deal of pain.</p>

<p>I am going to send you his letter as well, or rather a
copy, and you will decide; you will quite see there is no
harm in what he asks. However, if you think that it must
not be, I promise you to restrain myself; but I believe
that you will think like me, and that there is no harm
there.</p>

<p>Whilst I am about it, Madame, permit me to ask you
one more question. They have always told me that it was
wrong to love anyone; but why is that? What makes
me ask you is that M. le Chevalier Danceny maintains
that it is not wrong at all, and that almost everybody
loves; if that is so, I do not see why I should be the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
only one to refrain from it; or is it then that it is only
wrong for young ladies? For I have heard Mamma herself
say that Madame D*** was in love with Monsieur M***, and
she did not speak of it as a thing which was so very wrong;
and yet I am sure she would be angry with me, if she
were only to suspect my liking for M. Danceny. She
treats me always like a child, does Mamma; and she
tells me nothing at all. I believed, when she took me from
the convent, that it was to marry me; but at present
it seems no: it is not that I care about it, I assure you;
but you who are so friendly with her know, perhaps, how
it stands; and, if you know, I hope you will tell me. This
is a very long letter, Madame; but, since you have allowed
me to write to you, I have profited by it to tell you
all, and I count on your friendship.</p>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">What</span>, Mademoiselle! you still refuse to answer me!
Nothing can bend you, and each day bears away with it
the hope which it had brought! What then is this friendship
which you agree subsists between us, if it be not even
powerful enough to render you sensible to my pain; if
it leaves you cold and tranquil, whilst I experience the
torments of a fire that I cannot extinguish; if, far from
inspiring you with confidence, it does not even suffice to
induce your pity? What! your friend suffers and you
do nothing to help him! He does but ask you for a
word, and you refuse him that! And you wish him to
content himself with a sentiment so feeble, of which you
even fear to reiterate the assurance!</p>

<p>You would not be ungrateful, you said yesterday: ah,
believe me, Mademoiselle, to be ready to repay love with
friendship is not to fear ingratitude, it is to dread only
the having the appearance of it. However, I dare not
discuss with you a sentiment which can only be a burden
to you, if it does not interest you; I must at least confine
it within myself until I learn how to conquer it. I feel
how painful this task will be; I do not hide from myself
that I shall have need of all my strength; I will attempt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
every means; there is one which will cost my heart most
dearly, it is that of repeating to myself often that your
own is insensible. I will even try to see you less often,
and I am already busy in seeking a plausible excuse.</p>

<p>What! I should lose the sweet habit of seeing you every
day! Ah, at least I shall never cease to regret it! An
eternal sorrow will be the price of the most tender love;
and you will have wished it, and it will be your work!
Never, I feel it, shall I recover the happiness I lose
to-day; you alone were made for my heart; with what
delight I would take a vow to live only for you! But this
vow you will not accept; your silence teaches me well
enough that your heart says nothing to you in my behalf:
it is at once the surest proof of your indifference and the
most cruel fashion of announcing it to me. Adieu, Mademoiselle.</p>

<p>I dare not flatter myself with the hope of a reply: love
would have written to me with impatience, friendship with
pleasure, even pity with complacence; but pity, friendship
and love are equally strangers to your heart.</p>

<br><small>CÉCILE VOLANGES TO SOPHIE CARNAY</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="noin">I <span class="smcap">told</span> you, Sophie, that there were cases in which one
might write; and I assure you that I reproach myself
greatly with having followed your advice, which has brought
so much grief to the Chevalier Danceny and to myself.
The proof that I was right is that Madame de Merteuil,
who is a woman who surely knows, thinks as I do.
I confessed everything to her. She talked to me at
first as you did: but when I had explained all to
her, she agreed that it was very different; she only asks
me to shew her all my letters and all those of the Chevalier
Danceny, in order to make sure that I say nothing but
what I should; thus, at present, I am tranquil. Heavens,
how I love Madame de Merteuil! She is so good! and
she is a woman very much respected. Thus, there is
nothing more to be said.</p>

<p>How I am going to write to M. Danceny, and how
pleased he will be! He will be even more so than he
thinks, for hitherto I have only spoken of my friendship,
and he always wanted me to tell him of my love. I think
it was much the same thing; but anyhow, I did not dare,
and he longed for that. I told this to Madame de Merteuil;
she told me that I was right, and that one ought
not to confess that one feels love, until one can no longer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
restrain one’s self: now I am sure that I could not restrain
myself any longer; after all, it is the same thing, and it
will give him greater pleasure.</p>

<p>Madame de Merteuil told me also that she would lend
me books which spoke of all that, and which would teach
me to behave myself properly, and to write better than I
know now: for, you see, she tells me of all my faults,
which is a proof how much she likes me; she has only
recommended me to say nothing to Mamma of these books,
because that would seem to suggest that she has neglected
my education, and that might vex her. Oh, I shall say
nothing about it to her!</p>

<p>It is very extraordinary, however, that a woman who is
scarcely related to me should take more care of me than
my mother! It is very lucky for me to have known her!</p>

<p>She has also asked Mamma to bring me the day after
to-morrow to the Opera, in her box; she has told me that
we shall be quite alone there, and we are to talk all the
time, without fear of being overheard: I like that much
better than the opera. We shall speak also of my marriage:
for she has told me that it was quite true that I was to
be married; but we have not been able to say more about
it. By the way, is it not astonishing that Mamma has said
nothing about it at all?</p>

<p>Adieu, my Sophie, I am going to write to the Chevalier
Danceny. Oh! I am very happy.</p>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">At</span> last, Monsieur, I consent to write to you, to assure you
of my friendship, of my <i>love</i>, since without that you would
be unhappy. You say that I have not a good heart;
I assure you, indeed, that you are mistaken, and I hope,
at present, you no longer doubt it. If you have been
grieved that I have not written to you, do you suppose
that that did not grieve me as well? But the fact is that,
for nothing in the world, would I like to do anything
that was wrong; and I would not even have told you of my
love, if I could have prevented myself: but your sadness
gave me too much pain. I hope that, at present, you will
be sad no longer, and that we shall both be very happy.</p>

<p>I trust to have the pleasure of seeing you this evening,
and that you will come early; it will never be so early
as I could wish. Mamma is to sup at home, and I
believe she will ask you to stay: I hope you will not be
engaged as you were the day before yesterday. Was the
supper you went to so very agreeable? For you went to it
very early. But come, let us not talk of that: now that
you know I love you, I hope you will remain with me
as much as you can, for I am only happy when I am
with you, and I should like you to feel the same.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span></p>

<p>I am very sorry that you are still sad at this moment, but
it is not my fault. I will ask if I may play on the harp
as soon as you arrive, in order that you may get my
letter at once. I can do no more.</p>

<p>Adieu, Monsieur. I love you well, with my whole heart:
the more I tell you, the better pleased I am; I hope that
you will be so too.</p>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">Yes</span>, without a doubt, we shall be happy. My happiness
is well assured, since I am loved by you; yours will never
end, if it is to last as long as that which you have
inspired in me. What! You love me, you no longer
fear to assure me of your <i>love</i>! <i>The more you tell me, the
better pleased you are!</i> After reading that charming <i>I love
you</i>, written by your hand, I heard your sweet mouth
repeat the confession. I saw fixed upon me those
charming eyes, which their expression of tenderness
embellished still more. I received your vow to live ever
for me. Ah, receive mine, to consecrate my whole life
to your happiness; receive it and be sure that I will never
betray it!</p>

<p>What a happy day we passed yesterday! Ah, why
has not Madame de Merteuil secrets to tell your Mamma
every day? Why must it be that the idea of constraint,
which follows us, comes to mingle with the delicious
recollection which possesses me? Why can I not hold
unceasingly that pretty hand, which has written to me
<i>I love you</i>, cover it with kisses, and avenge myself so for
the refusal you have given me of a greater favour!</p>

<p>Tell me, my Cécile, when your Mamma had returned;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
when we were forced by her presence to have only indifferent
looks for one another; when you could no
longer console me, with the assurance of your love, for the
refusal you made to give me any proofs of it: did you
have no sentiment of regret? Did you not say to yourself:
a kiss would have made him happier, and it is I who
have kept this joy from him? Promise me, my charming
friend, that on the first opportunity you will be less severe.
With the aid of this promise, I shall find the courage to
support the vexations which circumstances have in store
for us; and the cruel privations will be at least softened
by my certainty that you share my regret.</p>

<p>Adieu, my charming Cécile: the hour is at hand when
I must go to your house. It would be impossible to
quit you, were it not to go and see you again. Adieu,
you whom I love so dearly! you whom I shall love
ever more and more!</p>

<br><small>MADAME DE VOLANGES TO THE PRÉSIDENTE DE TOURVEL</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">You</span> ask me then, Madame, to believe in the virtue of
M. de Valmont? I confess that I cannot bring myself
to it, and that I should find it as hard a task to believe
in his honour, from the one fact that you relate to me, as
to believe in the viciousness of a man of known probity,
for the sake of one error. Humanity is not perfect in
any fashion; no more in the case of evil than in that of
good. The criminal has his virtues, just as the honest
man has his weaknesses. This truth appears to me all
the more necessary to believe, in that from it is derived
the necessity of indulgence towards the wicked as well as
to the good, and that it safeguards the latter from pride
as it does the former from discouragement. You will
doubtless think that I am practising but sorrily, at this
moment, the indulgence which I preach; but I see in it
only a dangerous weakness, when it leads us to treat the
vicious and the man of integrity alike.</p>

<p>I will not permit myself to criticize the motives of
M. de Valmont’s action; I would fain believe them as
laudable as the act itself: but has he any the less spent
his life in involving families in trouble, scandal and dishonour?
Listen, if you will, to the voice of the wretched man
he has succoured; but let not that prevent you from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
hearing the cries of the hundred victims whom he has
sacrificed. Were he only, as you say, an instance of
the danger of acquaintances, would that make him any
less dangerous as an acquaintance himself? You assume
him to be capable of a happy reformation? Let us go
further: suppose this miracle accomplished; would not
public opinion remain against him, and does not that
suffice to regulate your conduct? God alone can absolve
at the moment of repentance; he reads in men’s hearts:
but men can only judge of thoughts by deeds; and none
amongst them, after having lost the esteem of others, has
a right to complain of the necessary distrust which
renders this loss so difficult to repair. Remember above
all, my dear young friend, that it sometimes suffices to
lose this respect, merely to have the air of attaching too
little value to it; and do not tax this severity with injustice:
for, apart from our being obliged to believe that
no one renounces this precious possession who has the
right to pretend to it, he is, indeed, more liable to misdoing
who is not restrained by this powerful brake. Such,
nevertheless, would be the aspect under which an intimate
acquaintance with M. de Valmont would display
you, however innocent it might be.</p>

<p>Alarmed at the warmth with which you defend him,
I hasten to anticipate the objections which I foresee you
will make. You will quote Madame de Merteuil, to whom
this acquaintance has been pardoned; you will ask me
why I receive him at my house; you will tell me that, far
from being repulsed by people of honour, he is admitted,
sought after, even, in what is called good society. I
believe I can answer everything.</p>

<p>To begin with, Madame de Merteuil, a most estimable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
person indeed, has perhaps no other fault save that of
having too much confidence in her own strength; she is
a skilful guide who delights in taking a carriage betwixt
a mountain and a precipice, and who is only justified by
success: it is right to praise her, it would be imprudent
to imitate her; she herself admits it and reproaches herself
for it. In proportion as she has seen more, have her
principles become more severe; and I do not fear to
assure you that she would think as I do.</p>

<p>As to what concerns myself, I will not justify myself
more than others. No doubt I receive M. de Valmont,
and he is received everywhere: it is one inconsistency
the more to add to the thousand others which rule society.
You know, as well as I do, how one passes one’s life in
remarking them, bemoaning them, and submitting to them.
M. de Valmont, with a great name, a great fortune, many
amiable qualities, early recognized that, to obtain an
empire over society, it was sufficient to employ, with
equal skill, praise and ridicule. None possesses as he does
this double talent: he seduces with the one, and makes
himself feared with the other. People do not esteem him;
but they flatter him. Such is his existence in the midst
of a world which, more prudent than courageous, would
rather humour than combat him.</p>

<p>But neither Madame de Merteuil herself, nor any other
woman, would for a moment think of shutting herself up
in the country, almost in solitude, with such a man. It
was reserved for the most virtuous, the most modest of
them all to set the example of such an inconsistency:
forgive the word, it escapes from my friendship. My lovely
friend, your very virtue betrays you by the security with
which it fills you. Reflect then that you will have for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
judges, on the one side, frivolous folk, who will not believe
in a virtue the pattern of which they do not find in themselves;
and on the other, the ill-natured, who will feign
not to believe in it, in order to punish you for its possession.
Consider that you are doing, at this moment, what certain
men would not venture to risk. In fact, amongst our
young men, of whom M. de Valmont has only too much
rendered himself the oracle, I remark the most prudent
fear to seem too intimate with him; and you, are you not
afraid? Ah, come back, come back, I conjure you!...
If my reasons are not sufficient to convince you, yield to
my friendship; it is that which makes me renew my entreaties,
it is for that to justify them. You think it severe,
and I trust that it may be needless; but I would rather
you had to complain of its anxiety than of its neglect.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="LETTER_THE_THIRTY-THIRD">LETTER THE THIRTY-THIRD

<br><small>THE MARQUISE DE MERTEUIL TO THE VICOMTE DE VALMONT</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">The</span> moment that you are afraid of success, my dear
Vicomte, the moment that your plan is to furnish arms
against yourself and that you are less desirous to conquer
than to fight, I have no more to say to you. Your
conduct is a masterpiece of prudence. It would be one
of folly in the contrary supposition; and, to tell the truth,
I fear that you are under an illusion.</p>

<p>What I reproach you with is not that you did not take
advantage of the moment. On the one side, I do not clearly
see that it had arrived; on the other, I am quite aware,
although they assert the contrary, that an occasion once
missed returns, whereas one never recovers a too precipitate
action. But the real blunder is that you should have
let yourself start a correspondence. I defy you at present
to foretell whither that may lead you. Do you hope, by
any chance, to prove to this woman that she must surrender?
It appears to me that therein can only lie a
truth of sentiment and not of demonstration; and that
to make her admit it is a matter of acting on her
feelings, and not of arguing; but in what will it serve you
to move her by letter, since you will not be at hand to
profit by it? If your fine phrases produce the intoxication<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
of love, do you flatter yourself that it will last so long
that there will be no time left for reflexion to prevent the
confession of it? Reflect only of the time it takes to
write a letter, of that which passes before it can be delivered,
and see whether a woman, especially one with the
principles of your <i>dévote</i>, can wish so long that which it
is her endeavour to wish never. This method may succeed
with children, who, when they write, “I love you,” do
not know that they say “I yield myself.” But the argumentative
virtue of Madame de Tourvel seems to me to
be fully aware of the value of terms. Thus, in spite of
the advantage which you had over her in your conversation,
she beats you in her letter. And then, do you
know what happens? Merely for the sake of argument,
one refuses to yield. By dint of searching for good reasons,
one finds, one tells them; and afterwards one clings to
them, not because they are good, so much as in order
not to give one’s self the lie.</p>

<p>In addition, a point which I wonder you have not yet
made: there is nothing so difficult in love as to write
what you do not feel. I mean to write in a convincing
manner: it is not that you do not employ the same words,
but you do not arrange them in the same way; or rather,
you arrange them, and that suffices. Read over your letter:
there is an order presiding over it which betrays you at
each turn. I would fain believe that your Présidente is too
little formed to perceive it: but what matter? it has no less
failed of its effect. It is the mistake of novels; the author
whips himself to grow heated, and the reader remains cold.
<i>Héloïse</i> is the only one which forms an exception, and,
in spite of the talent of the author, this observation has
ever made me believe that the substance of it was true.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
It is not the same in speaking. The habit of working the
instrument gives sensibility to it; the facility of tears is
added; the expression of desire in the eyes is confounded
with that of tenderness; in short, the less coherent speech
promotes more easily that air of trouble and confusion
which is the true eloquence of love; and above all the
presence of the beloved object forbids reflexion, and makes
us desire to be won.</p>

<p>Believe me, Vicomte: you are asked to write no more;
take advantage of that to retrieve your mistake, and wait
for an opportunity to speak. Do you know, this woman
has more strength than I believed? Her defence is good;
and, but for the length of her letter, and the pretext which
she gives you to return to the question in her phrase about
gratitude, she would not have betrayed herself at all.</p>

<p>What appears to me, again, to ensure your success is the
fact that she uses too much strength at one time; I foresee
that she will exhaust it in the defence of the word, and
that no more will be left her for that of the thing.</p>

<p>I return you your two letters, and, if you are prudent,
they will be the two last, until after the happy moment.
If it were not so late, I would speak to you of the little
Volanges who is coming on quickly enough, and with whom
I am greatly pleased. I believe that I shall have finished
before you, and you ought to be very glad thereat.
Adieu, for to-day.</p>

<br><small>THE VICOMTE DE VALMONT TO THE MARQUISE DE MERTEUIL</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">You</span> speak with perfect truth, my fair friend: but why put
yourself to so much fatigue to prove what nobody disputes?
To move fast in love, ’tis better to speak than to write;
that is, I believe, the whole of your letter. Why,
those are the most simple elements in the art of seduction!
I will only remark that you make but one exception to
this principle, and that there are two. To children, who
walk in this way from shyness and yield themselves from
ignorance, must be added the <i>femmes beaux-esprits</i>,
who let themselves be enticed therein by self-conceit and
whom vanity leads into the snare. For instance, I am
quite sure that the Comtesse de B***, who answered my
first letter without any difficulty, had, at that time, no more
love for me than I for her, and that she only saw an occasion
for treating a subject which should be worthy of her pen.</p>

<p>However that may be, an advocate will tell you that
principles are not applicable to the question. In fact,
you suppose that I have a choice between writing and
speaking, which is not the case. Since the affair of the
19th, my fair barbarian, who keeps on the defensive,
has shown a skill in avoiding interviews which has disconcerted
my own. So much so that, if this continues,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
I shall be forced to occupy myself seriously with the means
of regaining this advantage; for assuredly I will not be
routed by her in any way. My letters even are the subject
of a little war; not content with leaving them unanswered,
she refuses to receive them. For each one a
fresh artifice is necessary, and it does not always succeed.</p>

<p>You will remember by what a simple means I gave her
the first; the second presented no further difficulty. She
had asked me to return her letter; I gave her my own
instead, without her having the least suspicion. But whether
from vexation at having been caught, or from caprice or,
in short, virtue, for she will force me to believe in it, she
obstinately refused the third. I hope, however, that the
embarrassment into which the consequence of this refusal
has happened to throw her will correct her for the future.</p>

<p>I was not much surprised that she would not receive
this letter, which I offered her quite simply; that would
already have been to grant a certain favour, and I am
prepared for a longer defence. After this essay, which
was but an attempt made in passing, I put my letter in
an envelope; and seizing the moment of the toilette, when
Madame de Rosemonde and the chamber-maid were
present, I sent it her by my <i>chasseur</i>, with an order to
tell her that it was the paper for which she had asked
me. I had rightly guessed that she would dread the
scandalous explanation which a refusal would necessitate:
she took the letter; and my ambassador, who had
received orders to observe her face, and who has good
eyes, did but perceive a slight blush, and more embarrassment
than anger.</p>

<p>I congratulated myself then, for sure, either that she would
keep this letter, or that, if she wished to return it to me,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
it would be necessary for her to find herself alone with
me, which would give me a good occasion to speak. About
an hour afterwards, one of her people entered my room,
and handed me, on behalf of his mistress, a packet of
another shape than mine, on the envelope of which I
recognized the writing so greatly longed for. I opened
it in haste.... It was my letter itself, the seal unbroken,
merely folded in two. I suspect that her fear that I
might be less scrupulous than herself on the subject of
scandal had made her employ this devil’s ruse.</p>

<p>You know me: I need be at no pains to depict to you
my fury. It was necessary, however, to regain one’s <i>sang-froid</i>,
and seek for fresh methods. This is the only one
that I found:</p>

<p>They send from here every morning to fetch the letters
from the post, which is about three quarters of a league
away: they employ for this purpose a box with a lid almost
like an alms-box, of which the post-master has one key
and Madame de Rosemonde the other. Everyone puts
his letters in it during the day, when it seems good to
him: in the evening they are carried to the post, and in
the morning those which have arrived are sent for. All
the servants, strange or otherwise, perform this service.
It was not the turn of my servant; but he undertook
to go, under the pretext that he had business in that
direction.</p>

<p>Meantime I wrote my letter. I disguised my handwriting
in the address, and I counterfeited with some skill upon
the envelope the stamp of Dijon. I chose this town,
because I found it merrier, since I was asking for the
same rights as the husband, to write also from the same place,
and also because my fair had spoken all day of the desire<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
she had to receive letters from Dijon. It seemed to me
only right to procure her this pleasure.</p>

<p>These precautions once taken, it was easy enough to
add this letter to the others. I moreover succeeded by
this expedient in being a witness of the reception; for
the custom is to assemble for breakfast, and to wait for the
arrival of the letters before separating.</p>

<p>Madame de Rosemonde opened the box. “From Dijon,”
she said, giving the letter to Madame de Tourvel.</p>

<p>“It is not my husband’s writing,” she answered in a
troubled voice, hastily breaking the seal.</p>

<p>The first glances instructed her; and her face underwent
such an alteration that Madame de Rosemonde perceived
it, and asked, “What is the matter with you?”</p>

<p>I also drew near, saying, “Is this letter then so very
dreadful?”</p>

<p>The shy <i>dévote</i> dared not raise her eyes; she said not a
word; and, to hide her embarrassment, pretended to run
over the epistle, which she was scarcely in a state to read.
I enjoyed her confusion, and not being sorry to gird her a
little, I added, “Your more tranquil air bids me hope that
this letter has caused you more astonishment than pain.”
Anger then inspired her better than prudence could
have done.</p>

<p>“It contains,” she answered, “things which offend me, and
that I am astounded anyone has dared to write to me.”</p>

<p>“Who has sent it?” interrupted Madame de Rosemonde.</p>

<p>“It is not signed,” answered the angry fair one; “but
the letter and its author inspire me with equal contempt.
You will oblige me by speaking no more of it.”</p>

<p>With that she tore up the audacious missive, put the
pieces into her pocket, rose, and left the room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span></p>

<p>In spite of this anger she has none the less had my
letter; and I rely upon her curiosity to have taken care
that she read it through.</p>

<p>The detailed relation of the day would take me too
far. I add to this account the first draft of my two
letters; you will thus be as fully informed as myself. If
you want to be <i>au courant</i> with this correspondence, you
must accustom yourself to deciphering my minutes; for
nothing in the world could I support the tedium of copying
them. Adieu, my lovely friend!</p>

that, in the midst of the faults which you are pleased to
ascribe to me, there is left me at least enough delicacy
not to permit myself a reproach, and enough courage to
impose on myself the most grievous sacrifices. You order
me to be silent and to forget! Well! I will force my
love to be silent; and I will forget, if that be possible,
the cruel manner in which you have met it. Doubtless
my desire to please you did not bear with it the right;
and more, I confess that the need I had of your indulgence
was not a title to obtain it: but you look upon
my love as an outrage; you forget that if it could be a
wrong, you would be at once its cause and its excuse.</p>

<p>You forget also, that, accustomed to open my soul to
you, even when that confidence might hurt me, it was
impossible for me to conceal from you the sentiments by
which I was penetrated; and that which was the result
of my good faith you consider as the fruit of my audacity.
As a reward for the most tender, the most respectful, the
truest love, you cast me afar from you. You speak to
me, lastly, of your hatred.... What other than myself
would not complain at being so treated? I alone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
submit; I support it all, and murmur not; you strike, and
I adore. The inconceivable power which you have over
me renders you absolute mistress of my feelings; and if
only my love resists you, if you cannot destroy that, it
is because it is your work and not my own.</p>

<p>I do not ask for a love which I never flattered myself
I should receive. I do not even ask for that pity for
which the interest you had sometimes displayed in me
might have allowed me to hope. But, I admit, I think
I can count on your sense of justice.</p>

<p>You inform me, Madame, that people have sought to
damage me in your opinion. If you had believed the
counsels of your friends, you would not even have let
me approach you: those are your expressions. Who then
are these officious friends? No doubt those people of
such severity, and of so rigid a virtue, consent to be
named; no doubt they would not cover themselves in an
obscurity which would confound them with vile calumniators;
and I shall not be left ignorant either of their
names or of their accusations. Reflect, Madame, that I
have the right to know both, since it is after them you
judge me. One does not condemn a culprit without
naming his accusers. I ask no other favour, and I promise
in advance to justify myself, and to force them to
retract.</p>

<p>If I have, perhaps, too much despised the vain clamours
of a public of which I make so little case, it is not thus
with your esteem; and when I devote my life to meriting
that, I shall not let it be ravished from me with impunity.
It becomes all the more precious to me, in that I shall
owe to it doubtless that request which you fear to make
me, and which would give me, you say, <i>rights to your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
gratitude</i>. Ah! far from exacting it, I shall believe myself
your debtor, if you procure me the occasion of being
agreeable to you. Begin then to do me greater justice
by not leaving me in ignorance of what you desire of me.
If I could guess it, I would spare you the trouble of
saying it. To the pleasure of seeing you, add the happiness
of serving you, and I will congratulate myself on
your indulgence. What then can prevent you? It is not,
I hope, the fear of a refusal: I feel that I could not
pardon you that. It is not only that I do not return
you your letter. More than you do I desire that it be
no longer necessary to me: but accustomed as I am to
believing in the gentleness of your soul, it is only in
that letter that I can find you such as you would appear.
When I frame the vow to render you less hard, I see
there that, rather than consent, you would place yourself
a hundred leagues away from me; when everything in
you augments and justifies my love, it is that still which
repeats to me that my love is an outrage to you; and
when, seeing you, that love seems to me the supreme
good, I needs must read you to feel that it is but a
fearful torture. You can imagine now that my greatest
happiness would be to be able to return you this fatal
letter: to ask me for it now would be to authorize me to
believe no longer what it contains; you do not doubt, I
hope, of my eagerness to return it to you.</p>

<br><small>THE VICOMTE DE VALMONT TO THE PRÉSIDENTE DE TOURVEL</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="center">(Bearing the postmark of Dijon)</p>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">Your</span> severity augments daily, Madame; and, if I dare
say it, you seem to be less afraid of being unjust than of
being indulgent. After having condemned me without a
hearing, you must have felt, in fact, that ’twere easier
for you not to read my arguments than to reply to them.
You refuse my letters obstinately; you send them back to
me with contempt. You force me, at last, to have
recourse to a ruse, at the very moment when my only
aim is to convince you of my good faith. The necessity
in which you have put me to defend myself will doubtless
suffice to excuse my means. Convinced, moreover, by
the sincerity of my sentiments that, to justify them in
your eyes, it is sufficient merely that you should know
them thoroughly, I thought that I might permit myself
this slight artifice. I dare believe also that you will
pardon me, and that you will be little surprised that love is
more ingenious in presenting itself than indifference in
repelling it.</p>

<p>Allow then, Madame, my heart to be entirely revealed
to you. It belongs to you, and it is just that you
should know it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span></p>

<p>I was very far from foreseeing, when I arrived at Madame
de Rosemonde’s, the fate which awaited me. I did not
know that you were there, and I will add, with the
sincerity which characterizes me, that, if I had known, my
sense of security would not have been troubled: not that
I did not render to your beauty the justice which one
could not refuse it; but, accustomed as I was to feel only
desires, and to yield myself only to those which were
encouraged by hope, I did not know the torments of love.</p>

<p>You were a witness of the efforts which Madame de
Rosemonde made to keep me for some time. I had already
passed one day with you, and yet I yielded, or at
least believed that I yielded, only to the pleasure, so natural
and so legitimate, of showing respect to a worthy relative.
The kind of life which one led here doubtless differed
greatly from that to which I was accustomed; it cost me
nothing to conform to it; and, without seeking to penetrate
into the cause of the change which was operating within
me, I attributed it as yet solely to that easy-going character
of which I believe I have already spoken to you.</p>

<p>Unfortunately (yet why need it be a misfortune?), coming
to know you better, I soon discovered that that bewitching
face, which alone had struck me, was but the least of your
attractions; your heavenly soul astonished and seduced my
own. I admired the beauty, I worshipped the virtue.
Without pretending to win you, I bestirred myself to deserve
you. In begging your indulgence for the past, I was ambitious
of your support for the future. I sought for it in your
utterance, I spied for it in your eyes, in that glance
whence came a poison all the more dangerous in that it
was distilled without design, and received without distrust.</p>

<p>Then I knew love. But how far was I from complaining.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
Determined to bury it in an eternal silence, I abandoned
myself without fear, as without reserve, to this delicious
sentiment. Each day augmented its sway. Soon the
pleasure of seeing you was changed to a need. Were
you absent for a moment? my heart was sore with sadness;
at the sound which announced your return, it palpitated
with joy. I only existed for you and through you.
Nevertheless, it is yourself whom I call to witness: in the
merriment of our heedless sports or in the interest of a
serious conversation, did ever one word escape me which
could betray the secret of my heart?</p>

<p>At last a day arrived when my evil fortune was to
commence; by an inconceivable fatality, a good deed was
to be the signal for it. Yes, Madame, it was in the midst
of those unfortunates whom I had succoured that, abandoning
yourself to that precious sensibility which embellishes
even beauty and adds value to virtue, you completed
your work of destroying a heart which was already intoxicated
with excess of love. You will remember, perhaps, what a
moodiness came over me on our return! Alas! I was
seeking to fight against an affection which I felt was becoming
stronger than myself.</p>

<p>It was after I had exhausted my strength in this unequal
contest, that an unforeseen hazard made me find myself
alone with you. There, I confess, I succumbed. My heart
was too full, and could withhold neither its utterance nor
its tears. But is this then a crime? and if it be one, is
it not amply punished by the dire torments to which I
am abandoned?</p>

<p>Devoured by a love without hope, I implore your pity
and I meet only with your hate: with no other happiness
than that of seeing you, my eyes seek you in spite of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
myself, and I tremble to meet your gaze. In the cruel
state to which you have reduced me, I pass my days in
dissimulating my grief and my nights in abandoning myself
to it; whilst you, peaceful and calm, know of these
torments only to cause them and to applaud yourself for
them. None the less, it is you who complain and I who
make excuse.</p>

<p>That, however, Madame, is the faithful relation of what
you call my injuries, which it would, perhaps, be more
just to call my misfortunes. A pure and sincere love, a
respect which has never belied itself, a perfect submission;
such are the sentiments with which you have inspired me.
I would not fear to present my homage of them to the
Divinity Himself. O you, who are His fairest handiwork,
imitate Him in His indulgence! Think on my cruel pains;
think, above all, that, placed by you between despair and
supreme felicity, the first word which you shall utter will
for ever decide my lot.</p>

<br><small>THE PRÉSIDENTE DE TOURVEL TO MADAME DE VOLANGES</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="noin">I <span class="smcap">yield</span>, Madame, to the counsels which your friendship
gives me. Accustomed as I am to defer in all
things to your opinions, I am ready to believe that they
are always based on reason. I will even admit that M.
de Valmont must be, indeed, infinitely dangerous, if he
can, at the same time, feign to be what he appears here
and remain such a man as you paint him. However that
may be, since you request it, I will keep him away from
me; at least I will do my utmost: for often things which
ought to be at bottom the most simple become embarrassing
in practice.</p>

<p>It still seems to me impracticable to make this request
to his aunt; it would be equally ungracious both to her
and to him. Neither would I adopt the course, without
the greatest repugnance, of going away myself: for apart
from the reasons I have already given you relative to M.
de Tourvel, if my departure were to annoy M. de Valmont,
as is possible, would it not be easy for him to follow me
to Paris? And his return, of which I should be—or at
least should appear—the motive, would it not seem more
strange than a meeting in the country, at the house of a
lady who is known to be his relation and my friend?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span></p>

<p>There is left me then no other resource than to induce
himself to consent to going away. I know that this proposal
is difficult to make; however, as he seems to me to
have set his heart on proving to me that he has, effectually,
more honesty than is attributed to him, I do not
despair of success. I shall not be sorry even to attempt
it, and to have an occasion of judging whether, as he has
often said, truly virtuous women never have had, and never
will have, to complain of his behaviour. If he leaves, as
I desire, it will indeed be out of consideration for me;
for I cannot doubt but that he proposes to spend a
great part of the autumn here. If he refuses my request
and insists upon remaining, there will still be time for me
to leave myself, and that I promise you.</p>

<p>That is, I believe, Madame, all that your friendship
demanded of me; I am eager to satisfy it, and to prove
to you that in spite of the <i>warmth</i> I may have used to
defend M. de Valmont, I am none the less disposed, not
only to heed, but also to follow, the counsels of my
friends.</p>

<p>I have the honour to be, etc.</p>

<br><small>THE MARQUISE DE MERTEUIL TO THE VICOMTE DE VALMONT</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">Your</span> enormous budget, my dear Vicomte, has this moment
arrived. If the date on it is exact, I ought to have
received it twenty-four hours earlier; be that as it may,
if I were to take the time to read it, I should have none
left to reply to it. I prefer then simply to acknowledge
it now, and we will talk of something else. It is not that
I have anything to say to you on my own account; the
autumn leaves hardly a single man with a human face in
Paris, so that for the last month I have been perishing
with virtue; and anyone else than my Chevalier would
be fatigued with the proofs of my constancy. Being unable
to occupy myself, I distract myself with the little Volanges,
and it is of her that I wish to speak.</p>

<p>Do you know that you have lost more than you believe,
in not undertaking this child? She is really delicious!
She has neither character nor principles; judge how sweet
and easy her society will be. I do not think she
will ever shine by sentiment; but everything announces in
her the liveliest sensations. Lacking wit and subtilty, she
has, however, if one may so speak, a certain natural falseness
which sometimes astonishes even me, and which
will be all the more successful, in that her face presents<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
the image of candour and ingenuousness. She is naturally
very caressing, and I sometimes amuse myself thereby:
her little head grows excited with incredible rapidity, and
she is then all the more delightful, because she knows
nothing, absolutely nothing, of all that she so greatly
desires to know. She is seized with quite droll fits of
impatience; she laughs, pouts, cries, and then begs me to
teach her with a truly seductive good faith. Really, I am
almost jealous of the man for whom that pleasure is
reserved.</p>

<p>I do not know if I have told you that for the last
four or five days I have had the honour of being in her
confidence. You can very well guess that, at first, I
acted severity: but as soon as I perceived that she thought
she had convinced me with her bad reasons, I had the
air of taking them for good ones; and she is intimately
persuaded that she owes this success to her eloquence:
this precaution was necessary in order not to compromise
myself. I have permitted her to write, and to say <i>I love</i>;
and the same day, without her suspecting it, I contrived
for her a <i>tête-à-tête</i> with her Danceny. But imagine, he is
still such a fool that he did not even obtain a kiss.
The lad, however, writes mighty pretty verses! La,
how silly these witty folks are! This one is, to such a
degree that he embarrasses me; for, as for him, I cannot
well drive him!</p>

<p>It is at this moment that you would be very useful to
me. You are sufficiently intimate with Danceny to obtain
his confidence, and, if he once gave it you, we should
advance at full speed. Make haste, then, with your
Présidente; for, indeed, I will not have Gercourt escape:
for the rest, I spoke of him yesterday to the little person,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
and depicted him so well to her that, if she had been
his wife for ten years, she could not hate him more. I
preached much to her, however, upon the subject of
conjugal fidelity; nothing could equal my severity on this
point. By that, on the one side, I restore my reputation
for virtue with her, which too much condescension might
destroy; on the other, I augment in her that hatred with
which I wish to gratify her husband. And, finally, I hope
that, by making her believe that it is not permitted her
to give way to love, except during the short time that
she remains a girl, she will more quickly decide to lose
none of that time.</p>

<p>Adieu, Vicomte; I am going to attend to my toilette,
what time I will read your volume.</p>

<br><small>CÉCILE VOLANGES TO SOPHIE CARNAY</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="noin">I <span class="smcap">am</span> sad and anxious, my dear Sophie. I wept almost
all night. It is not that I am not, for the moment, very
happy, but I foresee that it will not last.</p>

<p>I went yesterday to the Opera with Madame de Merteuil;
we spoke much of my marriage, and I have learned no
good of it. It is M. le Comte de Gercourt whom I am
to wed, and it is to be in the month of October. He is
rich, he is a man of quality, he is colonel of the Regiment
of ——. So far, all very well. But, to begin with, he is
old: imagine, he is at least thirty-six! and then, Madame
de Merteuil says he is gloomy and stern, and she fears
I shall not be happy with him. I could even see quite
well that she was sure of it, only that she would not say
so for fear of grieving me. She hardly talked to me of
anything the whole evening, except of the duties of wives
to their husbands: she admits that M. de Gercourt is
not at all lovable, and yet she says I must love him.
Did not she say also that, once married, I ought not to
love the Chevalier Danceny any longer? as though that
were possible! Oh, you can be very sure I shall love
him always! Do you know, I would prefer not to be
married. Let this M. de Gercourt look after himself,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
I never went in search of him. He is in Corsica at
present, far away from here; I wish he would stay there
ten years. If I were not afraid of being sent back to
the convent, I would certainly tell Mamma that I don’t
want a husband like that; but that would be still worse.
I am very much embarrassed. I feel that I have never
loved M. Danceny so well as I do now; and when I think
that I have only a month more left me, to be as I am
now, the tears rush suddenly to my eyes; I have no
consolation except the friendship of Madame de Merteuil;
she has such a good heart! She shares in all my troubles
as much as I do myself; and then she is so amiable that,
when I am with her, I hardly think any more of them.
Besides, she is very useful to me, for the little that I
know she has taught me: and she is so good that I can
tell her all I think, without being in the least ashamed.
When she finds that it is not right, she scolds me sometimes;
but only quite gently, and then I embrace her with
all my heart, until she is no longer cross. Her, at any rate,
I can love as much as I like, without there being any
harm in it, and that pleases me very much. We have
agreed, however, that I am not to have the appearance
of being so fond of her before everybody, and especially
not before Mamma, so that she may have no suspicions
about the Chevalier Danceny. I assure you that, if I
could always live as I do now, I believe I should be very
happy. It’s only that horrid M. de Gercourt.... But I
will say no more about him, else I should get sad again.
Instead of that, I am going to write to the Chevalier
Danceny; I shall only speak to him of my love and not
of my troubles, for I do not want to distress him.</p>

<p>Adieu, my dear friend. You can see now that you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
would be wrong to complain, and that however <i>busy</i> I
have been, as you say, there is time left me, all the same,
to love you and to write to you.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<br><small>THE VICOMTE DE VALMONT TO THE MARQUISE DE MERTEUIL</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">Not</span> content with leaving my letters without reply, with
refusing to receive them, my inhuman wretch wishes to
deprive me of the sight of her; she insists on my departure.
What will astonish you more is that I am submitting to
her severity. You will blame me. However, I thought I
ought not to lose the opportunity of obeying a command,
persuaded as I am, on the one side, that to command is to
commit one’s self; and on the other, that that illusive
authority which we have the appearance of allowing
women to seize is one of the snares which they find it
most difficult to elude. Nay, more, the skill which this
one has shown in avoiding a solitary encounter with me
placed me in a dangerous situation, from which I thought
I was bound to escape, whatever might be the cost: for,
being constantly with her, without being able to occupy
her with my love, there was reason to fear that she might
grow accustomed to seeing me without trouble, a disposition
from which you know how difficult it is to return.</p>

<p>For the rest, you may guess that I did not submit
without conditions. I was even at the pains to impose
one which it was impossible to grant, as much for the
sake of remaining always free to keep my word or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
break it, as to promote a discussion, either by word of
mouth or in writing, at a time when my beauty is more
contented with me, or has need that I should be so with
her: not to reckon that I should show a signal lack of
skill if I did not find a means to obtain some compensation
for my desisting from this pretension, untenable as
it may be.</p>

<p>After having explained my motives in this long preamble,
I come to the history of the last two days. I enclose as
documentary evidence my beauty’s letter and my reply.
You will agree that few historians are as precise as I.</p>

<p>You will remember the effect produced by my letter
from Dijon, on the morning of the day before yesterday;
the rest of the day was most stormy. The pretty prude
only appeared at dinner-time, and gave out that she had
a violent headache: a pretext with which she masked one
of the most furious fits of ill-humour that a woman could
have. It absolutely altered her face; the expression of
gentleness, which you know, was changed into a rebellious
air which gave it a fresh loveliness. I promise myself
to make use of this discovery, and to replace sometimes
the tender mistress with the sullen.</p>

<p>I foresaw that the time after dinner would be dull; and,
to escape from ennui, I made a pretext of having letters
to write, and retired to my own rooms. I returned to
the salon about six o’clock; Madame de Rosemonde
suggested a drive, which was agreed to. But just as we
were getting into the carriage, the pretended invalid, with
infernal malice, alleged in her turn—perhaps to avenge
herself for my absence—an increase of the pain, and
compelled me pitilessly to support a <i>tête-à-tête</i> with my
old aunt. I know not whether the imprecations which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
I called down on this feminine demon were heeded; but
we found her gone to bed on our return.</p>

<p>On the following day, at breakfast, it was not the same
woman. Her natural sweetness had returned, and I had
reason to believe myself pardoned. Breakfast was hardly
over, when the sweet person rose with an indolent air,
and went into the park; as you may believe, I followed
her. “Whence can spring this desire for walking?” said
I, accosting her. “I wrote much, this morning,” she
answered, “and my head is a little tired.” “I am not
fortunate enough,” I went on, “to have to reproach myself
with this fatigue?” “Indeed, I have written to you,” she
answered again, “but I hesitate to give you my letter. It
contains a request, and you have not accustomed me to
hope for success.” “Ah! I swear, if it be possible—”
“Nothing could be easier,” she broke in; “and although
you ought, perhaps, to grant it out of justice, I consent
to obtain it as a grace.” As she said these words, she
handed me her letter; seizing it, I also seized her hand,
which she drew away, but without anger, and with more
embarrassment than vivacity. “The heat is even greater
than I thought,” she said, “I must go indoors.” And
she retraced her steps to the <i>château</i>. I made vain
efforts to persuade her to continue her walk, and I needed
to remind myself that we might be observed, in order to
employ no more than eloquence. She entered without a
word, and I saw plainly that this pretended walk had no
other object than to hand me my letter. She went up to
her own room as soon as we came in, and I withdrew to
mine, to read the epistle, which you will do well to read
also, as well as my reply, before proceeding further....</p>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">It</span> seems to me, Monsieur, by your behaviour, as though
you did but seek to multiply daily the causes of complaint
which I have against you. Your obstinacy in wishing
unceasingly to approach me with a sentiment which I would
not and may not heed, the abuse which you have not
feared to take of my good faith, or of my timidity, in order
to put your letters into my hands; above all the method,
most indelicate I venture to call it, which you employed
to make the last reach me, without the slightest fear of
the effect of a surprise which might have compromised
me; all ought to give occasion on my part to reproaches
as keen as they are merited. However, instead of returning
to these grievances, I confine myself to putting a request
to you, as simple as it is just; and if I obtain it from you,
I consent that all shall be forgotten.</p>

<p>You yourself, have said to me, Monsieur, that I need
not fear a refusal; and, although, by an inconsistency
which is peculiar to you, this very phrase was followed
by the only refusal which you could make me,<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> I would
fain believe that you will none the less keep to-day that
word, given to me formally so few days ago.</p>

<p>I desire you then to have the complaisance to go away<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
from me; to leave this <i>château</i>, where a further stay on
your part could not but expose me more to the judgment
of a public which is ever ready to think ill of others, and
which you have but too well accustomed to fix its gaze
upon the women who admit you to their society. Already
warned, long ago, of this danger by my friends, I neglected,
I even disputed their warning, so long as your behaviour
towards myself could make me believe that you would not
confound me with the host of women who all have had reason
to complain of you. To-day, when you treat me like them,
as I can no longer but know, I owe it to the public, to my
friends, to myself, to adopt this necessary course. I might
add here that you would gain nothing by denying my request,
as I am determined to leave myself, if you insist on remaining;
but I do not seek to diminish the obligation
which you will confer on me by this complaisance, and
I am quite willing that you should know that, by rendering
my departure hence necessary, you would upset my arrangements.
Prove to me then, Monsieur, that, as you have
so often told me, virtuous women shall never have cause
to complain of you; prove, at least, that, when you have
done them wrong, you know how to repair it. If I thought I
had need to justify my request to you, it would suffice to
say that you have spent your life in rendering it necessary;
and that, notwithstanding, it has not rested with me that I
should ever make it. But let us not recall events which I
would forget, and which would oblige me to judge you with
rigour at a moment when I offer you an opportunity of earning
all my gratitude. Adieu, Monsieur; your conduct will
teach me with what sentiments I must be, for life, your most
humble, etc.</p>

<br><small>THE VICOMTE DE VALMONT TO THE PRÉSIDENTE DE TOURVEL</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">However</span> hard, Madame, the conditions that you impose
on me, I do not refuse to fulfil them. I feel that it
would be impossible for me to thwart any of your desires.
Once agreed upon this point, I dare flatter myself
in my turn that you will permit me to make certain
requests to you, far easier to grant than your own, which,
however, I do not wish to obtain, save by my complete
submission to your will.</p>

<p>The one, which I hope will be solicited by your sense
of justice, is to be so good as to name to me those who
have accused me to you; they have done me, it seems,
harm enough to give me the right of knowing them: the
other, which I expect from your indulgence, is kindly to
permit me to repeat to you sometimes the homage of a
love which will now, more than ever, deserve your pity.</p>

<p>Reflect, Madame, that I am hastening to obey you,
even when I can but do it at the expense of my happiness;
I will say more, in spite of my conviction that you
only desire my absence in order to spare yourself the
spectacle, always painful, of the object of your injustice.</p>

<p>Admit, Madame, you are less afraid of a public which
is too much used to respecting you to dare form a disrespectful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
judgment upon you than you are annoyed by
the presence of a man whom you find it easier to punish
than to blame. You drive me away from you as one
turns away one’s eyes from some poor wretch whom one
does not wish to succour.</p>

<p>But, whereas absence is about to redouble my torments,
to whom other than you can I address my complaints?
From whom else can I expect the consolations which are
about to become so necessary to me? Will you refuse me
them, when you alone cause my pains?</p>

<p>Doubtless, you will not be astonished either that, before
I leave, I have it on my heart to justify to you the sentiments
which you have inspired in me; as also that I do
not find the courage to go away until I receive the order
from your mouth. This twofold reason compels me to
ask you for a moment’s interview. In vain would we seek
to supply the place of that by letters: one may write
volumes and explain poorly what a quarter of an hour’s
conversation were enough to leave amply understood. You
will easily find the time to accord it me; for, however
eager I may be to obey you, you know that Madame de
Rosemonde is aware of my intention to spend a part of the
autumn with her, and I must at least wait for a letter in
order to have the pretext of some business to call me away.</p>

<p>Adieu, Madame; never has this word cost me so much
to write as at this moment, when it brings me back to the
idea of our separation. If you could imagine what it
makes me suffer, I dare believe you would have some
thanks for my docility. At least, receive with more
indulgence the assurance and the homage of the most
tender and the most respectful love.</p>

<br><small>THE VICOMTE DE VALMONT TO THE MARQUISE DE MERTEUIL</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">And</span> now let us sum up, my lovely friend. You can
feel, like myself, how the scrupulous, the virtuous Madame
de Tourvel cannot grant me the first of my requests, and
betray the confidence of her friends, by naming to me my
accusers; thus, by promising everything on this condition,
I pledge myself to nothing. But you will feel also that
the refusal which she will give me will become a title to
obtain everything else; and that then I gain, by going away,
the advantage of entering into a regular correspondence
with her, and by her consent: for I take small account of
the interview which I ask of her, and which has hardly any
other object than that of accustoming her beforehand not
to refuse me others when they become really needful.</p>

<p>The only thing which remains for me to do before my
departure is to find out who are the people who busy
themselves with damaging me in her eyes. I presume it is
her pedant of a husband; I would fain have it so: apart
from the fact that a conjugal prohibition is a spur to desire,
I should feel sure that, from the moment my beauty has
consented to write to me, I should have nothing to fear
from her husband, since she would already be under the
necessity of deceiving him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span></p>

<p>But if she has a friend intimate enough to possess her
confidence, and this friend be against me, it seems to me
necessary to embroil them, and I count on succeeding in
that: but before all I must be rightly informed.</p>

<p>I quite thought that I was going to be yesterday; but
this woman does nothing like another. We were visiting
her at the moment when it was announced that dinner
was ready. Her toilette was only just completed; and
while I bestirred myself and made my apologies, I perceived
that she had left the key in her writing-desk; and I
knew her custom was not to remove that of her apartment.
I was thinking of this during dinner, when I heard her
waiting-maid come down: I seized my chance at once;
I pretended that my nose was bleeding, and left the room.
I flew to the desk; but I found all the drawers open
and not a sheet of writing. Yet one has no opportunity
of burning papers at this season. What does she do with
the letters she receives? And she receives them often. I
neglected nothing; everything was open, and I sought
everywhere; but I gained nothing except a conviction
that this precious store-house must be her pocket.</p>

<p>How to obtain them? Ever since yesterday I have
been busying myself vainly in seeking for a means:
yet I cannot overcome the desire. I regret that I
have not the talents of a thief. Should these not, in
fact, enter into the education of a man who is mixed
up in intrigues? Would it not be agreeable to filch the
letter or the portrait of a rival, or to pick from the
pockets of a prude the wherewithal to unmask her? But
our parents have no thought for anything; and for me,
’tis all very well to think of everything, I do but perceive
that I am clumsy, without being able to remedy it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span></p>

<p>However that may be, I returned to table much dissatisfied.
My beauty, however, soothed my ill-humour
somewhat, with the air of interest which my pretended
indisposition gave her; and I did not fail to assure her
that for some time past I had had violent agitations which
had disturbed my health. Convinced as she is that it
is she who causes them, ought she not, in all conscience,
to endeavour to assuage them? But <i>dévote</i> though she
be, she has small stock of charity; she refuses all amorous
alms, and such a refusal, to my view, justifies a theft.
But adieu; for all the time I talk to you, I am thinking of
those cursed letters.</p>

</div>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">Why</span> seek, Monsieur, to diminish my gratitude? Why be
willing to give me but a half-obedience, and make, as it
were, a bargain of an honourable action? Is it not sufficient
for you then that I feel the cost of it? You not
only ask much, but you ask things which are impossible.
If, in truth, my friends have spoken to me of you, they
have only done it in my interest: even if they have been
deceived, their intention was none the less good; and
you propose to me to reward this mark of attachment on
their part by delivering you their secret! I have already
done wrong in speaking to you of it, and you make
me very conscious of that at this moment. What would
have been no more than candour with another becomes
a blunder with you, and would lead me to an ignominy
did I yield to you. I appeal to yourself, to your honour;
did you think me capable of such a proceeding? Ought
you to have suggested it to me? No, without a doubt;
and I am sure that, on further reflexion, you will not
repeat this request.</p>

<p>That which you make as to writing to me is scarcely
easier to grant; and, if you care to be just, it is not me
whom you will blame. I do not wish to offend you;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
but, with the reputation which you have acquired, and
which, by your own confession, is at least in part deserved,
what woman could own to be in correspondence with
you? and what virtuous woman may determine to do something
which she feels she will be obliged to conceal?</p>

<p>Again, if I were assured that your letters would be
of a kind of which I need never have to complain, so
that I could always justify myself in my own eyes for having
received them! Perhaps then the desire of proving to
you that it is reason and not hate which sways me would
induce me to waive those powerful considerations, and to
do much more than I ought, in allowing you sometimes
to write to me. If indeed you desire to do so as much
as you say, you will voluntarily submit to the one condition
which could make me consent; and if you have any
gratitude for what I am now doing for you, you will not
defer your departure.</p>

<p>Permit me to remark to you on this subject that you
received a letter this morning, and that you have not
taken advantage of it to announce your going to Madame
de Rosemonde, as you had promised me. I hope that
at present nothing need prevent you keeping your word.
I count, above all, on your not waiting for the interview
which you ask of me, and to which I absolutely decline
to lend myself; and I hope that, instead of the order
which you pretend is necessary to you, you will content
yourself with the prayer which I renew to you. Adieu,
Monsieur.</p>

<br><small>THE VICOMTE DE VALMONT TO THE MARQUISE DE MERTEUIL</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">Join</span> in my joy, my lovely friend; I am beloved, I have
triumphed over that rebellious heart. ’Tis in vain that it
still dissimulates; my fortunate skill has surprised its
secret. Thanks to my energetic pains, I know all that
is of interest to me: since the night, the fortunate night
of yesterday, I am once more in my element; I have
resumed my existence; I have unveiled a double mystery
of love and iniquity: I will delight in the one, I will
avenge myself for the other; I will fly from pleasure to
pleasure. The mere idea that I form of it transports
me to such a degree that I have some difficulty in recalling
my prudence; and shall have some, perhaps, in putting
order into this narrative which I make for you. Let us
try, however.</p>

<p>Yesterday, after I had written my letter to you, I
received one from the celestial <i>dévote</i>. I send it you;
you will see in it that she gives me, with as little
clumsiness as is possible, permission to write to her: but
she urges on my departure; and I quite felt that I could
not defer it too long without injuring myself.</p>

<p>Tormented, however, by the desire to know who could
have written against me, I was still uncertain as to what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
course I should take. I tried to win over the chamber-maid
and would fain persuade her to give up to me her
mistress’s pockets, which she could have easily laid hold
of in the evening, and which she could have replaced
in the morning, without exciting the least suspicion. I
offered ten louis for this slight service: but I only found
a baggage, scrupulous or afraid, whom neither my eloquence
nor my money could vanquish. I was still preaching to
her when the supper-bell rang. I was forced to leave her;
only too glad that she was willing to promise me secrecy,
on which you may judge I scarcely counted.</p>

<p>I had never been in a worse humour. I felt myself
compromised, and I reproached myself all the evening for
my foolish attempt.</p>

<p>When I had retired, not without anxiety, I sent for my
<i>chasseur</i>, who, in his quality of happy lover, ought to have
some credit. I wanted him either to persuade this girl
to do what I had asked of her, or at least to make sure
of her discretion; but he, who ordinarily is afraid of
nothing, seemed doubtful of the success of the negociation,
and made a reflexion on the subject the profundity of
which amazed me.</p>

<p>“Monsieur surely knows better than I,” said he, “that
to lie with a girl is only to make her do what she likes
to do: from that to making her do what we like is
often a long way.”</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Le bon sens du maraud quelquefois m’épouvante.</i><a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>“I can the less answer for her,” he added, “because I
have reason to believe she has a lover, and that I only
owe her to the idleness of country life. So that, were it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>not for my zeal in Monsieur’s service, I should not
have had her but once.” (He is a real treasure this fellow!)
“As for secrecy,” he went on, “what will be the
good of making her promise it, since she will run no risk
in deceiving us? To speak again to her about it would
only be to let her know that it was important, and thus
make her all the more eager to use it for making up to
her mistress.”</p>

</div>
<div class="sync">&#160;</div>
<p>The more just these reflexions seemed to me, the more
was my embarrassment heightened. Luckily the knave
was started off to gossip; and as I had need of him, I let
him run on. While he was relating to me his adventures
with this wench, I learned that, as the chamber which
she occupied was only separated from that of her mistress
by a bare partition, through which any suspicious noise
could be heard, it was in his own that they met every
night. At once, I formed my plan; I communicated it
to him and we carried it out with success.</p>

<p>I waited until two o’clock in the morning; and then
betook myself, as we had agreed, to the scene of the
<i>rendez-vous</i>, carrying a light with me, and pretending that
I had rung several times to no purpose. My confidant,
who plays his parts to a marvel, went through a little
scene of surprise, despair, and excuses, which I terminated
by sending him to heat me some water, of which I feigned
to have a need; whilst the scrupulous chamber-maid was
all the more shamefaced, in that my rascal, wishing to
improve on my projects, had induced her to make a
toilette which the season suggested but did not excuse.</p>

<p>As I felt that the more this wench was humiliated, the
more easily I should dispose of her, I allowed her to
change neither her position nor her costume; and after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
ordering my valet to await me in my room, I sat down
beside her on the bed, which was in great disorder,
and commenced my conversation. I had need to maintain
the control which the situation gave me over her; thus I
preserved a coolness which would have done honour to
the continence of Scipio; and without taking the slightest
liberty with her—which, however, her freshness and the
opportunity seemed to give her the right to expect—I
spoke of business to her as calmly as I should have done
with a lawyer.</p>

<p>My conditions were that I would faithfully keep her
secret, provided that, on the morrow, at about the same
hour, she would hand me the pockets of her mistress.
“Beside that,” I added, “I offered you ten louis yesterday;
I promise you them again to-day. I do not want to
take advantage of your situation.” Everything was
granted, as you may well believe; I then withdrew,
and allowed the happy couple to make up for lost
time.</p>

<p>I spent mine in sleep; and, on my awakening, desiring
to have a pretext for not replying to my fair one’s letter
before I had investigated her papers, which I could not
do until the ensuing night, I resolved to go out shooting,
which I did for the greater part of the day.</p>

<p>On my return, I was received coldly enough. I had
a mind to believe that we were a little offended at the
small zeal I had shown in not profiting by the time that
was left, especially after the much kinder letter which she
had written me. I judge so from the fact that Madame
de Rosemonde, having addressed me some reproaches for
this long absence, my beauty remarked with a tone of
acrimony, “Ah! do not let us reproach M. de Valmont<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
for giving himself up to the one pleasure which he can
find here.” I murmured at this injustice, and took advantage
of it to vow that I took so much pleasure in the ladies’
society that I was sacrificing for them a most interesting
letter which I had to write. I added that, being unable
to sleep for some nights past, I had wished to try if fatigue
would restore it me; and my eyes were sufficiently explicit,
both as to the subject of my letter and the cause of my
insomnia. I was at the pains to wear all that evening a
manner of melancholy sweetness, which seemed to sit on
me well enough, and which masked the impatience I
was in to see the hour arrive which was to deliver me
the secret so obstinately withheld from me. At last we
separated, and, some time afterwards, the faithful chamber-maid
came to bring me the price agreed upon for my
discretion.</p>

<p>Once master of this treasure, I proceeded to the inventory
with that prudence which you know I possess:
for it was important to put back everything in its place.
I fell at first upon two letters from the husband—an undigested
mixture of details of law-suits and effusions of
conjugal love, which I had the patience to read in their
entirety, and where I found no word that had any relation
to myself. I replaced them with temper: but this was
soothed when my hand lighted upon the pieces of my
famous Dijon letter, carefully put together. Luckily the
whim seized me to run through it. Judge of my joy when
I perceived very distinct traces of my adorable <i>dévote’s</i> tears.
I confess, I gave way to an impulse of youth, and kissed
this letter with a transport of which I had not believed
myself any longer capable. I continued my happy examination;
I found all my letters in sequence and order<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
of date; and what gave me a still more agreeable surprise
was to find the first of all, the one which I thought the
graceless creature had returned to me, faithfully copied by
her hand, and in an altered and tremulous hand, ample
witness to the soft perturbation of her heart during that
employment.</p>

<p>Thus far I was entirely given over to love; soon it gave
place to fury. Who do you think it is, that wishes
to ruin me in the eyes of the woman whom I adore?
What Fury do you suppose is vile enough to plot such a
black scheme? You know her: it is your friend, your
kinswoman; it is Madame de Volanges. You cannot
imagine what a tissue of horrors this infernal Megæra has
written concerning me. It is she, she alone, who has
troubled the security of this angelic woman; it is through
her counsels, through her pernicious advice, that I see myself
forced to leave; it is she, in short, who has sacrificed me. Ah!
without a doubt her daughter must be seduced: but that
is not enough, she must be ruined; and, since this cursed
woman’s age puts her beyond the reach of my assaults,
she must be hit in the object of her affections.</p>

<p>So she wishes me to come back to Paris! she forces
me to it! be it so, I will go back; but she shall bewail
my return. I am annoyed that Danceny is the hero of that
adventure; he possesses a fundamental honesty which will
embarrass us: however, he is in love, and I see him often;
perhaps one may make use of him. I am losing sight of
myself in my anger, and forgetting that I owe you an
account of what has passed to-day. To resume.</p>

<p>This morning I saw my sensitive prude again. Never
had I found her so lovely. It must ever be so: a woman’s
loveliest moment, the only one when she can produce that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
intoxication of the soul of which we speak so constantly
and which we so rarely meet, is that one when, assured
of her love, we are not yet of her favours; and that is
precisely the case in which I find myself now. Perhaps
too, the idea that I was going to be deprived of the
pleasure of seeing her served to beautify her. Finally,
with the arrival of the postman, I was handed your letter
of the 27th; and whilst I read it, I was still hesitating
as to whether I should keep my word: but I met my
beauty’s eyes, and it would have been impossible to me to
refuse her aught.</p>

<p>I then announced my departure. A moment later, Madame
de Rosemonde left us alone: but I was still four
paces away from the coy creature when, rising with an
affrighted air: “Leave me, leave me, Monsieur,” she said;
“in God’s name, leave me.”</p>

<p>This fervent prayer, which betrayed her emotion, could
not but animate me the more. I was already at her side,
and I held her hands which she had joined together with
a quite touching expression; I was beginning some tender
complaints, when some hostile demon brought back Madame
de Rosemonde. The timid <i>dévote</i>, who had, in
truth, some cause for fear, took advantage of this to
withdraw.</p>

<p>I offered her my hand, however, which she accepted;
and auguring well from this mildness, which she had not
shown for a long time, I sought to press hers, whilst again
commencing my complaints. At first she would fain
withdraw it; but at my more lively insistence, she abandoned
it with a good grace, although without replying
either to the gesture or to my remarks. Arrived before
the door of her apartment, I wished to kiss this hand,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
before I dropped it. The defence began by being hearty:
but a “remember that I am going away,” uttered most
tenderly, rendered it awkward and inefficient. Hardly
had the kiss been given, when the hand found strength
enough to escape, and the fair one entered her apartment,
where her chamber-maid was in attendance. Here finishes
my history.</p>

<p>As I presume that to-morrow you will be at the Maréchale’s,
where I certainly shall not go to look for you; as I
think it very likely too that, at our first interview, we shall
have more than one affair to discuss, and notably that of the
little Volanges, whom I do not lose sight of, I have decided
to have myself preceded by this letter, and, long as it is,
I shall not close it, until the moment comes for sending
it to the post: for, at the point which I have reached,
everything may depend on an opportunity, and I leave
you now to see if there be one.</p>

<p>P.S. <i>Eight o’clock in the evening.</i></p>

<p>Nothing fresh; not the least little moment of liberty:
care taken even to avoid it. However, at least as much
sorrow shown as decency permits. Another incident which
cannot be without consequences is that I am charged by
Madame de Rosemonde with an invitation to Madame de
Volanges to come and spend some time with her in the
country.</p>

<p>Adieu, my lovely friend; until to-morrow, or the day
after, at the latest</p>

<p class="noin">M. <span class="smcap">de Valmont</span> left this morning, Madame; you seemed
to me so anxious for his departure, that I thought I ought
to inform you of it. Madame de Rosemonde much regrets
her nephew, whose society, one must admit, is agreeable:
she passed the whole morning in talking of him, with that
sensibility which you know her to possess; she did not
stint his praises. I thought it was incumbent on me to
listen to her without contradiction, more especially as I must
confess that on many points she was right. In addition,
I felt that I had to reproach myself with being the cause
of this separation, and I cannot hope to be able to compensate
her for the pleasure of which I have deprived
her. You know that I have by nature small store of
gaiety, and the kind of life we are going to lead here is
not formed to increase it.</p>

<p>If I had not acted according to your advice, I should
fear that I had behaved somewhat lightly; for I was
really distressed at my venerable friend’s grief; she touched
me to such a degree that I could have willingly mingled
my tears with her own.</p>

<p>We live at present in the hope that you will accept
the invitation which M. de Valmont is to bring you, on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
the part of Madame de Rosemonde, to come and spend
some time with her. I hope that you have no doubt
of the pleasure it will give me to see you; and, in
truth, you owe us this recompense. I shall be most
delighted to have this opportunity of making an earlier
acquaintance with Mademoiselle de Volanges, and to have
the chance of convincing you more and more of the
respectful sentiments, etc.</p>

<br><small>THE CHEVALIER DANCENY TO CÉCILE VOLANGES</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">What</span> has happened to you then, my adored Cécile?
What can have caused in you so sudden and cruel an
alteration? What has become of your vows of never
changing? It was only yesterday that you repeated them
with so much pleasure! Who can have made you forget
them to-day? It is useless for me to examine myself; I
cannot find the cause of it in me; and it is terrible that
I should have to seek it in you. Ah! doubtless you are
neither light nor deceitful; and even in this moment of
despair, no insulting suspicion shall defile my soul. Yet,
by what fatality comes it that you are no longer the same?
No, cruel one, you are no longer the same! The tender
Cécile, the Cécile whom I adore, and whose vows I
have received, would not have avoided my gaze, would
not have resisted the happy chance which placed me
beside her; or, if any reason which I cannot understand
had forced her to treat me with such severity, she would,
at least, have condescended to inform me of it.</p>

<p>Ah, you do not know, you will never know, my Cécile,
all that you have made me suffer to-day, all that I
suffer still at this moment. Do you suppose then that I
can live, if I am no longer loved by you? None the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
less, when I asked you for a word, one single word to
dispel my fears, instead of answering me you pretended
to be afraid of being overheard; and that difficulty which
did not then exist, you immediately brought about yourself
by the place which you chose in the circle. When,
compelled to leave you, I asked you at what hour
I could see you again to-morrow, you pretended that
you could not say, and Madame de Volanges had to be
my informant. Thus the moment, ever desired so fondly,
which is to bring me into your presence, to-morrow, will
only excite in me anxiety; and the pleasure of seeing you,
hitherto so dear to my heart, will give place to the fear
of being intrusive.</p>

<p>I feel it already, this dread irks me, and I dare not
speak to you of my love. That <i>I love you</i>, which I loved
so well to repeat when I could hear it in my turn;
that soft phrase which sufficed for my felicity, offers me,
if you are changed, no more than the image of an eternal
despair. I cannot believe, however, that that
talisman of love has lost all its power, and I am fain to
employ it once more.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> Yes, my Cécile, <i>I love you</i>.
Repeat after me then this expression of my happiness.
Remember that you have accustomed me to the hearing
of it, and that to deprive me of it is to condemn me to
a torture which, like my love, can only end with my life.</p>

<br><small>THE VICOMTE DE VALMONT TO THE MARQUISE DE MERTEUIL</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">To-day</span> again I shall not see you, my lovely friend, and
here are my reasons, which I beg you to meet with
indulgence.</p>

<p>Instead of returning here directly, I stopped with the
Comtesse de ***, whose <i>château</i> lay almost upon my road,
and of whom I asked a dinner. I did not reach Paris
until about seven o’clock, and I alighted at the Opera,
where I hoped to find you.</p>

<p>The Opera over, I went to see my fair friends of the
green-room; I found there my whilom Émilie, surrounded by
a numerous court, women as well as men, to whom she
was offering a supper that very evening at P——. I had
no sooner entered this assemblage than I was invited to
the supper by acclamation. I also received one from a
little fat and stumpy person, who stammered his invitation
to me in the French of Holland, and whom I recognized
as the true hero of the <i>fête</i>. I accepted.</p>

<p>I learned upon my way that the house whither we
were going was the price agreed upon for Émilie’s favours
towards this grotesque figure, and that this supper was a
veritable wedding-breakfast. The little man could not
contain himself for joy, in expectation of the pleasure which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
awaited him; he seemed to me so satisfied with the
prospect that he gave me a longing to disturb it; which
was, effectually, what I did.</p>

<p>The only difficulty I found was that of persuading
Émilie, who was rendered somewhat scrupulous by the
burgomaster’s wealth. She agreed, however, after raising
some objections, to the plan which I suggested of filling
this little beer-barrel with wine, and so putting him <i>hors
de combat</i> for the rest of the night.</p>

<p>The sublime idea which we had formed of a Dutch
toper caused us to employ all available means. We
succeeded so well that, at dessert, he was already without
the strength to lift his glass: but the helpful Émilie and
myself vied with one another in filling him up. Finally,
he fell beneath the table, in so drunken a state, that it
ought to last for at least a week. We then decided
to send him back to Paris; and, as he had not kept his
carriage, I had him carried into mine, and remained in
his stead. I thereupon received the congratulations of the
company, which soon afterwards retired, and left me in
possession of the field. This gaiety, and perhaps my long
rustication, made Émilie seem so desirable to me that I
promised to stay with her until the Dutchman’s resurrection.</p>

<p>This complaisance on my part is the price of that
which she has just shown me, that of serving me for a
desk upon which to write to my fair puritan, to whom I
found it amusing to send a letter written in the bed, and
almost in the arms, of a wench, a letter interrupted even
to complete an infidelity, in which I send her an exact
account of my position and my conduct. Émilie, who has
read the epistle, laughed like a mad girl over it, and I
hope that you will laugh as well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span></p>

<p>As my letter must needs bear the Paris post-mark, I
send it to you; I leave it open. Will you please read it,
seal it up, and commit it to the post. Above all, be
careful not to employ your own seal, nor even any
amorous device; a simple head. Adieu, my lovely friend.</p>

<p>P.S. I open my letter; I have persuaded Émilie to go
to the <i>Italiens</i>.... I shall take advantage of that moment
to come and see you. I shall be with you by six o’clock
at the latest; and if it be agreeable to you, we will go
together, about seven o’clock, to Madame de Volanges.
Propriety commands that I do not postpone the invitation
with which I am charged for her from Madame de
Rosemonde; moreover, I shall be delighted to see the
little Volanges.</p>

<p>Adieu, most fair lady. I shall be as pleased to embrace
you, as the Chevalier will be jealous.</p>

<br><small>THE VICOMTE DE VALMONT TO THE PRÉSIDENTE DE TOURVEL</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="center">(Bearing the postmark of Paris)</p>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">It</span> is after a stormy night, during which I have not closed
my eyes; it is after having been ceaselessly either in the
agitation of a devouring ardour, or in an utter annihilation
of all the faculties of my soul, that I come to seek with
you, Madame, the calm of which I have need, and
which, however, I have as yet no hope to enjoy. In
truth, the situation in which I am, whilst writing to you,
makes me realize more than ever the irresistible power of
love; I can hardly preserve sufficient control over myself
to put some order into my ideas; and I foresee already
that I shall not finish this letter without being forced to
interrupt it. What! Am I never to hope then that you
will some day share with me the trouble which overcomes
me at this moment? I dare believe, notwithstanding, that
if you were well acquainted with it, you would not be
entirely insensible. Believe me, Madame, a cold tranquillity,
the soul’s slumber, the imitation of death do not
conduce to happiness; the active passions alone can lead
us thither; and, in spite of the torments which you make me
suffer, I think I can assure you without risk that at this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
moment I am happier than you. In vain do you overwhelm
me with your terrible severities; they do not
prevent me from abandoning myself utterly to love, and
forgetting, in the delirium which it causes me, the despair
into which you cast me. It is so that I would avenge
myself for the exile to which you condemn me. Never
had I so much pleasure in writing to you; never have I
experienced, during such an occupation, an emotion so
sweet and, at the same time, so lively. Everything seems
to enhance my transports; the air I breathe is laden
with pleasure; the very table upon which I write to you,
consecrated for the first time to this office, becomes love’s
sacred altar to me; how much it will be beautified in
my eyes! I shall have traced upon it the vow to love
you for ever! Pardon, I beseech you, the disorder of my
senses. Perhaps, I ought to abandon myself less to transports
which you do not share: I must leave you for a
moment to dispel an intoxication which increases each
moment, and which becomes stronger than myself.</p>

<p>I return to you, Madame, and doubtless, I return always
with the same eagerness. However, the sentiment of
happiness has fled far away from me; it has given place
to that of cruel privation. What does it avail me to speak
of my sentiments, if I seek in vain the means to convince
you of them? After so many efforts, I am equally bereft
of strength and confidence. If I still tell over to myself
the pleasures of love, it is only to feel more keenly my
sorrow at being deprived of them. I see no other resource,
save in your indulgence; and I am too sensible at this
moment of how greatly I need it, to hope to obtain it.
Never, however, has my love been more respectful, never
could it be less likely to offend you; it is of such a kind,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
I dare say, as the most severe virtue need not fear: but
I am myself afraid of describing to you, at greater length,
the sorrow which I experience. Assured as I am that the
object which causes it does not participate in it, I must
at any rate not abuse your kindness; and it would be to
do that, were I to spend more time in retracing for you
that dolorous picture. I take only enough to beg you to
reply to me, and never to doubt of the sincerity of my
sentiments.</p>

</div>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">Without</span> being either false or frivolous, Monsieur, it is
enough for me to be enlightened as to my conduct, to
feel the necessity of altering it; I have promised this
sacrifice to God, until such a time when I can offer Him
also that of my sentiments towards you, which are rendered
even more criminal by the religious character of your estate.
I feel certain that it will only bring me sorrow, and I will
not even hide from you that, since the day before yesterday,
I have wept every time I have thought of you. But
I hope that God will do me the grace of giving me the
needful strength to forget you, as I ask of Him morning
and evening. I expect also of your friendship and of your
honour that you will not seek to shake me in the good
resolution which has been inspired in me, and in which
I strive to maintain myself. In consequence, I beg you
to have the kindness to write no more to me, the more
so as I warn you that I should no longer reply to you,
and that you would compel me to acquaint Mamma with
all that has passed; and that would deprive me entirely
of the pleasure of seeing you.</p>

<p>I shall, none the less, retain for you all the attachment
which one may have without there being harm in it; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
it is indeed with all my soul that I wish you every kind
of happiness. I quite feel that you will no longer love
me as much as you did, and that, perhaps, you will soon
love another better than me. But that will be one
penance the more for the fault which I have committed
in giving you my heart, which I ought to give only to
God and my husband when I have one. I hope that
the Divine mercy will take pity on my weakness, and that
it will give me no more sorrow than I am able to support.</p>

<p>Adieu, Monsieur; I can truly assure you that, if I were
permitted to love anybody, I should never love anybody
but you. But that is all I may say to you; and perhaps
even that is more than I ought to say.</p>

THE PRÉSIDENTE DE TOURVEL TO THE VICOMTE DE VALMONT</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">Is</span> it thus then, Monsieur, that you carry out the conditions
upon which I consented sometimes to receive your
letters? And have I <i>no reason for complaint</i> when you
speak to me of a sentiment to which I should still fear
to abandon myself, even if I could do so without violating
all my duties? For the rest, if I had need of fresh
reasons to preserve this salutary dread, it seems to me
that I could find them in your last letter. In effect, at
the very moment when you think to make an apology
for love, what else are you doing but revealing to me
its redoubtable storms? Who can wish for happiness
bought at the expense of reason, whose short-lived
pleasures are followed at any rate by regret, if not by
remorse?</p>

<p>You yourself, in whom the habit of this dangerous
delirium ought to diminish its effect, are you not, however,
compelled to confess that it often becomes stronger
than yourself; and are you not the first to lament the
involuntary trouble which it causes you? What fearful
ravages then would it not effect on a fresh and sensitive
heart, which would still augment its empire, by the
sacrifices it would be forced to make to it?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span></p>

<p>You believe, Monsieur, or you feign to believe that
love leads to happiness; and I—I am so convinced that
it would render me unhappy that I would not even hear
its name pronounced. It seems to me that only to speak
of it destroys tranquillity; and it is as much from inclination
as from duty that I beg you to be good enough
to keep silence on this subject.</p>

<p>After all, this request should be very easy for you to
grant me at present. Returned to Paris, you will find
there occasions enough to forget a sentiment which, perhaps,
only owed its birth to the habit you are in of
occupying yourself with such subjects, and its strength
to the idleness of country life. Are you not then in
that town where you had seen me with so much
indifference? Can you take a step there without
encountering an example of your readiness to change?
And are you not surrounded there by women who,
all more amiable than myself, have better right to your
homage?</p>

<p>I am without the vanity with which my sex is reproached;
I have still less of that false modesty which is nothing
but a refinement of pride; and it is with the utmost
good faith that I tell you here, I know how few pleasing
qualities I possess: had I all there were, I should not
believe them sufficient to retain you. To ask you then
to occupy yourself no longer with me is only to beg
you to do to-day what you had already done before,
and what you would most assuredly do again in a short
time, even if I were to ask the contrary.</p>

<p>This truth, which I do not lose sight of, would be,
itself, a reason strong enough to disincline me to listen to
you. I have still a thousand others, but without entering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
upon a long discussion, I confine myself to begging you,
as I have done before, to correspond with me no further
upon a sentiment to which I must not listen, and to
which I ought even less to reply.</p>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">Really</span>, Vicomte, you are insupportable. You treat me
as lightly as though I were your mistress. Do you know
that I shall get angry, and that at the present moment I
am in a fearful temper? Why! you have to see Danceny
to-morrow morning; you know how important it is that I
should speak to you before that interview; and without
troubling yourself any more about it, you keep me waiting
all day to run off I know not where. You are the
cause of my arriving at Madame de Volanges’ <i>indecently</i>
late, and of my being found <i>surprising</i> by all the old
women. I was obliged to flatter them during the whole of
the evening in order to appease them: for one must never
annoy the old women; it is they who make the young
one’s reputations.</p>

<p>It is now one o’clock in the morning; and instead of
going to bed, which I am dying to do, I must needs
write you a long letter, which will make me twice as
sleepy from the <i>ennui</i> it causes me. You are most
fortunate that I have not time to scold you further. Do
not believe for that reason that I forgive you: it is only
that I am pressed for time. Listen to me then, I hasten
to come to the point.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span></p>

<p>However little skill you may exert, you are bound
to-morrow to have Danceny’s confidence. The moment
is favourable for confidence: it is the moment of unhappiness.
The little girl has been to confession: like a child, she has
told everything; and ever since she has been tormented
to such a degree by the fear of the devil that she insists
on breaking it off. She related to me all her little scruples
with a vivacity which told me how excited she was. She
showed me her letter announcing the rupture, which was
a real sermon. She babbled for an hour to me, without
uttering one word of common sense. But she embarrassed
me none the less; for you can imagine that I could not
risk opening my mind to such a wrong-headed creature.</p>

<p>I saw, however, through all this verbiage, that she is
as fond of her Danceny as ever; I even remarked one of
those resources which love never fails to find, and of
which the little girl is an amusing dupe. Tormented by
her desire to occupy herself with her lover, and by the
fear of being damned if she does so, she has invented
the plan of praying God that she may be able to forget
him; and as she repeats this prayer at every moment of
the day, she finds a means thereby of thinking of him
unceasingly.</p>

<p>With any more <i>experienced</i> than Danceny, this little
incident would perhaps be more favourable than the reverse;
but the young man is so much of a Céladon that, if we
do not help him, he will require so much time to overcome
the slightest obstacles that there will be none left
for us to carry out our project.</p>

<p>You are quite right; it is a pity, and I am as vexed as
you, that he should be the hero of this adventure: but
what would you have? What is done is done; and it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
your fault. I asked to see his reply;<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> it was really pitiful.
He produces arguments till he is out of breath, to prove
to her that an involuntary sentiment cannot be a crime:
as if it did not cease to be involuntary once one ceases
to fight against it! That idea is so simple that it even
suggested itself to the little girl. He complains of his
unhappiness in a manner that is touching enough: but
his grief is so gentle, and seems so strong and so sincere,
that it seems to me impossible that a woman who finds
occasion to reduce a man to such a degree of despair,
and with so little danger, is not tempted to get rid of
her fancy. Finally he explains that he is not a monk, as
the little one believed; and that is, without contradiction,
the best thing he has done: for, if it is a question of going
so far as to abandon yourself to monastic loves, it is
assuredly not the Knights of Malta who would deserve
the preference.</p>

<p>Be that as it may, instead of wasting time in arguments
which would have compromised me, perhaps without convincing,
I approved her project of rupture: but I said that
it was nicer, in such a case, to tell your reasons rather
than to write them; that it was customary also to return
letters and any other trifles one might have received; and
appearing thus to enter into the views of the little person,
I persuaded her to grant an interview to Danceny. We
formed our plans on the spot, and I charged myself with
the task of persuading the mother to go abroad without
her daughter; it is to-morrow afternoon that this decisive
moment will take place. Danceny is already informed of
it; but for God’s sake, if you get an opportunity, please<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
persuade this pretty swain to be less languorous, and teach
him—since he must be told everything—that the true
fashion to overcome scruples is to leave nothing to be
lost by those who possess them.</p>

<p>For the rest, in order to save a repetition of this ridiculous
scene, I did not fail to excite certain doubts in the
little girl’s mind, as to the discretion of confessors; and I
assure you, she is paying now for the fright which she
gave me, by her terror lest hers should go and tell everything
to her mother. I hope that, after I have talked
once or twice more with her, she will give up going thus
to tell her follies to the first comer.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>Adieu, Vicomte; take charge of Danceny and guide his
way. It would be shameful if we could not do what we
will with two children. If we find it more difficult than
we had thought at first, let us reflect, to animate our
zeal—you, that it is the daughter of Madame de Volanges
who is in question, I, that she is destined to become the
wife of Gercourt. Adieu.</p>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">You</span> forbid me, Madame, to speak to you of my love;
but where am I to find the necessary courage to obey
you? Solely occupied by a sentiment which should be
so sweet, and which you render so cruel; languishing in
the exile to which you have condemned me; living only
on privations and regrets; in prey to torments all the more
dolorous in that they remind me unceasingly of your
indifference; must I lose the only consolation which remains
to me? And can I have any other, save that of
sometimes laying bare to you a soul which you fill with
trouble and bitterness? Will you avert your gaze, that
you may not see the tears you cause to flow? Will you
refuse even the homage of the sacrifices you demand?
Would it not be worthier of you, of your good and gentle
soul, to pity an unhappy one who is only rendered so by
you, rather than to seek to aggravate his pain by a refusal
which is at once unjust and rigorous?</p>

<p>You pretend to be afraid of love, and you will not see
that you alone are the cause of the evils with which you
reproach it. Ah, no doubt, the sentiment is painful, when
the object which inspires it does not reciprocate; but where
is happiness to be found, if mutual love does not procure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
it? Tender friendship, sweet confidence—the only one
which is without reserve—sorrow’s alleviation, pleasure’s
augmentation, hope’s enchantment, the delights of remembrance:
where find them else than in love? You
calumniate it, you who, in order to enjoy all the good
which it offers you, have but to give up resisting it; and
I—I forget the pain which I experience in undertaking
its defence.</p>

<p>You force me also to defend myself; for, whereas I
consecrate my life to your adoration, you pass yours in
seeking reason to blame me: already you have assumed
that I am frivolous and a deceiver; and, taking advantage
of certain errors which I myself have confessed to you, you
are pleased to confound the man I was then with what I am
at present. Not content with abandoning me to the torment
of living away from you, you add to that a cruel banter as
to pleasures to which you know how you have rendered
me insensible. You do not believe either in my promises
or my oaths: well! there remains one guarantee for me
to offer you, which you will not suspect. It is yourself.
I only ask you to question yourself in all good faith: if you
do not believe in my love, if you doubt for a moment
that you reign supreme in my heart, if you are not sure
that you have fixed this heart, which, indeed, has thus
far been too fickle, I consent to bear the penalty of this
error; I shall suffer, but I will not appeal: but if, on the
contrary, doing justice to us both, you are forced to admit
to yourself that you have not, will never have a rival, ask
me no more, I beg you, to fight with chimeras, and leave
me at least the consolation of seeing you no longer in
doubt as to a sentiment which <i>indeed</i>, will not finish,
cannot finish, but with my life. Permit me, Madame,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
to beg you to reply positively to this part of my letter.</p>

<p>If, however, I give up that period of my life which
seems to damage me so severely in your eyes, it is not
because, in case of need, reasons had failed me to defend
it.</p>

<p>What have I done, after all, but fail to resist the vortex
into which I was thrown? Entering the world, young and
without experience; passed, so to speak, from hand to
hand by a crowd of women, who all hasten to forestall,
by their good-nature, a reflexion which they feel cannot
but be unfavourable to them; was it my part then to set
the example of a resistance which was never opposed to
me? Or was I to punish myself for a moment of error,
which was often provoked, by a constancy undoubtedly
useless, and which would only have excited ridicule? Nay,
what other cause, save a speedy rupture, can justify a
shameful choice?</p>

<p>But, I can say it, this intoxication of the senses, perhaps
even this delirium of vanity, did not attain to my heart.
Born for love, intrigue might distract it, but did not suffice
to occupy it; surrounded by seducing but despicable objects,
none of them reached as far as my soul: I was offered
pleasures, I sought for virtues; and in short, I even
thought myself inconstant because I was delicate and
sensitive.</p>

<p>It was when I saw you that I saw light: soon I understood
that the charm of love sprang from the qualities of
the soul; that they alone could cause its excess, and justify
it. I felt, in short, that it was equally impossible for me
not to love you, or to love any other than you.</p>

<p>There, Madame, is the heart to which you fear to trust
yourself, and on whose fate you have to pronounce: but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
whatever may be the destiny you reserve for it, you will
change nothing of the sentiments which attach it to you;
they are as inalterable as the virtues which have given
them birth.</p>

<p class="noin">I <span class="smcap">have</span> seen Danceny, but only obtained his half-confidence;
he insists especially on suppressing the name of
the little Volanges, of whom he only spoke to me as a
woman of great virtue, even somewhat a <i>dévote</i>: apart from
that, he gave me a fairly veracious account of his adventure,
particularly the last incident. I excited him as best I could,
I bantered him greatly upon his delicacy and scruples; but
it seems that he clings to them, and I cannot answer for
him: for the rest, I shall be able to tell you more after
to-morrow. I am taking him to-morrow to Versailles, and
I will occupy myself by studying him on the road. The
interview which is to take place to-day also gives me some
hope: everything may have happened to our satisfaction;
and perhaps there is nothing left for us at present but to
obtain a confession and collect the proofs. This task will be
easier for you than for me: for the little person is more confiding
or, what comes to the same thing, more talkative
than her discreet lover. However, I will do my utmost.</p>

<p>Adieu, my lovely friend; I am in a mighty hurry; I
shall not see you this evening, nor to-morrow: if you, on
your side, know anything, write me a word on my return.
I shall certainly come back to sleep in Paris.</p>

<br><small>THE MARQUISE DE MERTEUIL TO THE VICOMTE DE VALMONT</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">Oh</span> yes, it is certainly with Danceny that there is something
to discover! If he told you so, he was boasting.
I know nobody so stupid in an affair of love, and I
reproach myself more and more with the kindness we
have shown him. Do you know that yesterday I
thought I was compromised through him. And it would
have been a pure loss! Oh, I will have my revenge, I
promise you.</p>

<p>When I arrived yesterday to fetch Madame de Volanges,
she no longer wanted to go out; she felt indisposed; I
had need of all my eloquence to persuade her, and I
foresaw that Danceny might arrive before our departure,
which would have been all the more awkward, as Madame
de Volanges had told him the day before that she would
not be at home. Her daughter and I were on thorns.
At last we went out; and the little one pressed my hand
so affectionately as she bid me adieu that, in spite of her
intended rupture, with which she believed herself, in all
good faith, still to be occupied, I prophesied wonders in
the course of the evening.</p>

<p>I was not at the end of my anxieties. We had hardly
been half an hour at Madame de ***’s, when Madame<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
de Volanges felt really unwell, and naturally she wanted
to return home: as for me, I was the less inclined for it
in that I was afraid, supposing we were to surprise
the young people (as the chances were we should), that my
efforts to make the mother go abroad might seem highly
suspicious. I adopted the course of frightening her upon
her health, which luckily is not difficult; and I kept her
for an hour and a half, without consenting to drive her
home, by feigning fear at the consequences of the dangerous
motion of the carriage. We did not return until the hour
that had been fixed. From the shame-faced air which I
remarked on our arrival, I confess I hoped that at least
my trouble had not been wasted.</p>

<p>The desire I had for further information made me stay
with Madame de Volanges, who went to bed at once:
and after having supped at her bed-side, we left her at
an early hour, under the pretext that she had need of
repose, and passed into her daughter’s apartment. The
latter had done, on her side, all that I had expected of
her; vanished scruples, fresh vows of eternal love, etc.,
etc.: in a word, she had performed properly. But the fool,
Danceny, had not by one point passed the line where he
had been before. Oh! one can safely quarrel with such
a one: reconciliations are not dangerous.</p>

<p>The child assures me, however, that he wanted more,
but that she knew how to defend herself. I would wager
that she brags, or that she excuses him; indeed I made
almost certain of it. The fantasy seized me to find out
how much one might rely on the defence of which she
was capable; and I, a mere woman, bit by bit, excited
her to the point.... In short, you may believe me, no
one was ever more susceptible to a surprise of the senses.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>She is really lovable, this dear child! She deserves a
different lover; she shall have at least a firm friend, for
I am becoming really fond of her. I have promised her
that I will form her, and I think I shall keep my word.
I have often felt a need of having a woman in my confidence,
and I should prefer her to another; but I can do
nothing so long as she is not—what she needs to be;
and that is one reason the more for bearing a grudge
against Danceny.</p>

<br><small>CÉCILE VOLANGES TO SOPHIE CARNAY</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">You</span> were right, my dear Sophie; your prophesies succeed
better than your advice. Danceny, as you had
predicted, has been stronger than my confessor, than
you, than myself; and here we are returned precisely to
our old position. Ah! I do not repent it; and if you
scold me, it will be only because you do not know the
pleasure of loving Danceny. It is very easy to say what
one ought to do, nothing prevents you; but if you
had any experience of how we suffer from the pain of
somebody we love, of the way in which his pleasure
becomes our own, of how difficult it is to say no, when
what we wish to say is yes, you would be astonished
at nothing: I myself, who have felt it, felt it most keenly,
do not yet understand it. Do you suppose, for instance
that I could see Danceny weep, without weeping myself?
I assure you that that would be utterly impossible to me;
and, when he is happy, I am as happy as he. You may
say what you like: what one says does not change
things from what they are, and I am very certain that
it is like that.</p>

<p>I should like to see you in my place.... No, it
is not that I wish to say, for certainly I should not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
like to change places with anyone: but I wish that you
too loved somebody; not only because then you would
understand me better and scold me less; but also because
you would be happier, or, I should rather say, you would
only then begin to know happiness.</p>

<p>Our amusements, our merriment—all that, you see, is
only child’s play: nothing is left, when once it is over.
But love, ah, love!... a word, a look, only to know
he is there—that is happiness! When I see Danceny,
I ask for nothing more; when I cannot see him, I ask
only for him. I do not know how this is; but it would
seem as though everything which I like resembles him.
When he is not with me, I dream of him; and when
I can dream of him utterly, without distraction, when
I am quite alone, for instance, I am still happy; I
close my eyes, and suddenly I think I see him; I
remember his conversation, it causes me to sigh; and then
I feel a fire, an agitation.... I cannot keep in one
place. It is like a torment, and this torment gives me
an unutterable pleasure.</p>

<p>I even think that when once one has been in love, the
effect of it is shed even over friendship. That which I bear
for you has not changed however; it is always as it was
at the convent: but what I tell you of I feel for Madame
de Merteuil. It seems as though I love her more as I
do Danceny than as yourself; and sometimes I wish that
she were he. This is so, perhaps, because it is not a
children’s friendship like our own, or else because I
see them so often together, which makes me deceive myself.
Be that as it may, the truth is that, between the
two of them, they make me very happy; and, after all, I
do not think there is much harm in what I do. I would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
only ask to stay as I am; and it is only the idea of marriage
which distresses me: for if M. de Gercourt is such
a man as I am told, and I have no doubt of it, I do
not know what will become of me. Adieu, my Sophie;
I love you always most tenderly.</p>

<br><small>THE PRÉSIDENTE DE TOURVEL TO THE VICOMTE DE VALMONT</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">How</span>, Monsieur, would the answer which you ask of me
serve you? To believe in your sentiments would not that
be one reason the more to fear them? And without
attacking or defending their sincerity, does it not suffice,
ought it not to suffice for yourself, to know that I will
not and may not reply to them?</p>

<p>Supposing that you were to love me really (and it is
only to prevent a return to this subject that I consent to
the supposition), would the obstacles which separate us be
less insurmountable? And should I have aught else to
do, but to wish that you might soon conquer this love,
and above all, to help you with all my power by
hastening to deprive you of any hope? You admit
yourself that <i>this sentiment is painful, when the object which
inspires it does not reciprocate</i>. Now, you are thoroughly
well aware that it is impossible for me to reciprocate;
and even if this misfortune should befall me, I should
be the more to be pitied, without making you any
happier. I hope that you respect me enough, not to
doubt of that for a moment. Cease then, I conjure you,
cease from troubling a heart to which tranquillity is so
necessary; do not force me to regret that I have known you.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span></p>

<p>Loved and esteemed by a husband whom I both love
and respect, my duty and my pleasure are centred in
the same object. I am happy, I must be so. If pleasures
more keen exist, I do not desire them; I would not
know them. Can there be any that are sweeter than
that of being at peace with one’s self, of knowing only days
that are serene, of sleeping without trouble and awaking
without remorse? What you call happiness is but a
tumult of the senses, a tempest of passions of which the
mere view from the shore is terrible. Ah! why confront
these tempests? How dare embark upon a sea covered
with the <i>débris</i> of so many thousand shipwrecks? And
with whom? No, Monsieur, I stay on the shore; I
cherish the bonds which unite me to it. I would not
break them if I could; were I not held by them, I should
hasten to procure them.</p>

<p>Why attach yourself to my life? Why this obstinate
resolve to follow me? Your letters, which should be few,
succeed each other with rapidity. They should be sensible,
and you speak to me in them of nothing but your mad
love. You besiege me with your idea, more than you
did with your person. Removed in one form, you reproduce
yourself under another. The things which I asked
you not to say, you repeat only in another way.
It pleases you to embarrass me with captious arguments;
you shun my own. I do not wish to answer you, I will
answer you no more.... How you treat the women whom
you have seduced! With what contempt you speak of
them! I would fain believe that some of them deserve
it: but are they all then so despicable? Ah, doubtless,
since they have violated their duties in order to give
themselves up to a criminal love. From that moment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
they have lost everything, even the esteem of him for whom
they have sacrificed everything. The punishment is just,
but the mere idea makes one tremble. What matters it,
after all? Why should I occupy myself with them or
with you? By what right do you come to trouble my
tranquillity? Leave me, see me no more; do not write
to me again, I beg you; I demand it of you. This
letter is the last which you will receive from me.</p>

<br><small>THE VICOMTE DE VALMONT TO THE MARQUISE DE MERTEUIL</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="noin">I <span class="smcap">found</span> your letter yesterday on my arrival. Your anger
quite delighted me. You could not have had a more
lively sense of Danceny’s delinquencies, if they had been
exercised against yourself. It is no doubt out of vengeance
that you get his mistress into the habit of showing
him slight infidelities; you are a very wicked person!
Yes, you are charming, and I am not surprised that you
are more irresistible than Danceny.</p>

<p>At last I know him by heart, this pretty hero of
romance! He has no more secrets for me. I have told
him so often that virtuous love was the supreme good,
that one emotion was worth ten intrigues, that I was myself,
at this moment, amorous and timid; he found in me,
in short, a fashion of thinking so conformable with his
own, that, in the enchantment which he felt at my candour,
he told me everything and vowed me a friendship without
reserve. We are no more advanced for that in our
project.</p>

<p>At first, it seemed to me that he went on the theory
that a young girl demands much more consideration than a
woman, in that she has more to lose. He thinks, above
all, that nothing can justify a man for putting a girl into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
the necessity of marrying him, or living dishonoured,
when the girl is far richer than the man, which is the
case in which he finds himself. The mother’s sense of
security, the girl’s candour, all this intimidates and arrests
him. The difficulty would not be simply to dispute
these arguments, however true they may be. With a
little skill, and helped by passion, they would soon be
destroyed; all the more, in that they tend to be ridiculous,
and one would have the sanction of custom on one’s side.
But what hinders one from having any hold over him is
that he is happy as he is. Indeed, if a first love appears
generally more virtuous, and, as one says, purer; if, at
least, its course is slower, it is not, as people think, from
delicacy or shyness; it is that the heart, astonished at an
unknown emotion, halts, so to speak, at every step, to
relish the charm which it experiences, and that this charm
is so potent over a young heart that it occupies it to
such an extent that it is unmindful of every other pleasure.
That is so true, that a libertine in love—if such may
befall a libertine—becomes from that instant in less haste
for pleasure; in fact, between Danceny’s behaviour
towards the little Volanges, and my own towards the more
prudish Madame de Tourvel, there is but a shade of
difference.</p>

<p>It would have needed, to warm our young man, more
obstacles than he has encountered; above all, that there
should have been need for more mystery, for mystery
begets boldness. I am coming to believe that you have
hurt us by serving him so well; your conduct would have
been excellent with a man of <i>experience</i>, who would
have only felt desires: but you might have foreseen
that, with a young man who is honourable and in love,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
the greatest value of favours is that they should be the
proof of love; and, consequently, that, the surer he were of
being beloved, the less enterprising he would become.
What is to be done at present? I know nothing; but I
have no hope that the child will be caught before
marriage, and we shall have wasted our time: I am sorry
for it, but I see no remedy.</p>

<p>Whilst I am thus discoursing, you are doing better with
your Chevalier. That reminds me that you have promised
me an infidelity in my favour; I have your promise in
writing, and I do not want it to be a dishonoured draft.
I admit that the date of payment has not yet come; but
it would be generous of you not to wait for that; and on
my side, I would take charge of the interest. What do
you say, my lovely friend? Are you not tired of your
constancy? Is this Chevalier then such a miracle? Oh,
give me my way; I will indeed compel you to admit that
if you have found some merit in him, it is because you
have forgotten me.</p>

<p>Farewell, my lovely friend; I embrace you with all the
ardour of my desire; I defy all the kisses of the Chevalier
to contain as much.</p>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">Pray</span>, Madame, how have I deserved the reproaches which
you make me, and the anger which you display? The
liveliest attachment and, withal, the most respectful, the
most entire submission to your least wishes: there, in two
words, is the history of my sentiments and my conduct.
Oppressed by the pains of an unhappy love, I had no
other consolation than that of seeing you; you bade me
deprive myself of that; I obeyed you without permitting
myself a murmur. As a reward for this sacrifice, you
allowed me to write to you, and to-day you would rob
me of that solitary pleasure. Shall I see it ravished from
me without seeking to defend it? No, without a doubt:
ah, how should it not be dear to my heart? It is the
only one which remains to me, and I owe it to you.</p>

<p>My letters, you say, are too frequent! But reflect, I
beseech you, that during the ten days of my exile, I
have not passed one moment without thinking of you, and
that yet you have only received two letters from me. <i>I
only speak to you of my love!</i> Ah, what can I say, save
that which I think? All that I could do was to weaken
the expression of that; and you can believe me that
I only let you see what it was impossible for me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
to hide. Finally, you threaten me that you will no
longer reply to me! Thus, the man who prefers you to
everybody, and who respects even more than he loves
you: not content with treating him with severity, you would
add to it your contempt! And why these threats and
this anger? What need have you of them? Are you not
sure of being obeyed, even when your orders are unjust?
Is it possible for me then to dispute even one of your
desires, have I not already proved it? But will you abuse
this empire which you have over me? After having
rendered me unhappy, after having become unjust, will
you find it so easy then to enjoy that tranquillity which
you assure me is so necessary to you? Will you never
say to yourself: he has made me mistress of his fate, and
I have made him unhappy? He implored my aid, and I
looked at him without pity? Do you know to what point
my despair may carry me? No. To be able to appreciate
my sufferings, you would need to know the extent to
which I love you, and you do not know my heart.</p>

<p>To what do you sacrifice me? To chimerical fears. And
who inspires them in you? A man who adores you; a
man over whom you will never cease to hold an absolute
empire. What do you fear, what can you fear, from a
sentiment over which you will ever be mistress, to direct as
you will? But your imagination creates monsters for itself,
and you attribute the fright which they cause you to love.
A little confidence, and these phantoms will disappear.</p>

<p>A wise man said that, to dispel fears, it is almost always
sufficient to penetrate into their causes.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> It is in love<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
especially that this truth finds its application. Love, and
your fears will vanish. In the place of objects which
affright you, you will find a delicious emotion, a lover
tender and submissive, and all your days, marked by
happiness, will leave you no other regret than that of
having lost any by indifference. I myself, since I repented
of my errors and exist only for love, regret a time which I
thought I had passed in pleasure; and I feel that it lies
with you alone to make me happy. But, I beseech you,
let not the pleasure which I take in writing to you be
disturbed by the fear of displeasing you. I would not
disobey you; but I am at your knees; it is there I claim
the happiness of which you would rob me, the only one
which you have left me; I cry to you, heed my prayers
and behold my tears; ah, Madame, will you refuse me?</p>

effusion of Danceny? What has happened to him, and
what has he lost? Has his fair one, perchance, grown
vexed with his eternal respect? One must be just; we

be able to have a talk with you this morning? If you
are <i>engaged</i>, at least send me a word, and give me the
cues to my part.</p>

<p>Where were you yesterday, pray? I never succeed in
seeing you now. Truly, it was not worth the trouble of
keeping me in Paris in the month of September. Make
up your mind, however, as I have just received a very
pressing invitation from the Comtesse de B*** to go and
see her in the country; and, as she tells me, humorously
enough, “her husband has the finest woods in the world,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
which he carefully preserves for the pleasure of his friends.”
Now you know I have certainly some rights over the
woods in question; and I shall go and revisit them if I
am of no use to you. Adieu; remember Danceny will be
with me about four o’clock.</p>

<br><small>THE CHEVALIER DANCENY TO THE VICOMTE DE VALMONT</small></h2>

<p class="center">(Enclosed in the preceding letter)</p>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">Ah</span>, Monsieur, I am in despair, I have lost all! I dare
not confide to writing the secret of my woes: but I feel
a need to unburden them in the ear of a sure and trusty
friend. At what hour could I see you, and ask you for
advice and consolation? I was so happy on the day when
I opened my soul to you! Now, what a difference! All
is changed with me. What I suffer on my own account is
but the least part of my torments; my anxiety on behalf of
a far dearer object, that is what I cannot support. Happier
than I, you will be able to see her, and I count on your
friendship not to refuse me this favour: but I must see
you and instruct you. You will pity me, you will help
me; I have no hope save in you. You are a man of
sensibility, you know what love is, and you are the only one
in whom I can confide; do not refuse me your aid.</p>

<p>Adieu, Monsieur; the only alleviation of my pain is the
reflexion that such a friend as yourself is left to me. Let me
know, I beg you, at what hour I can find you. If it is not
this morning, I should like it to be early in the afternoon.</p>

<br><small>CÉCILE VOLANGES TO SOPHIE CARNAY</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">My</span> dear Sophie, pity your Cécile, your poor Cécile; she
is very unhappy! Mamma knows all. I cannot conceive
how she has come to suspect anything; and yet, she has
discovered everything. Yesterday evening, Mamma seemed
indeed to be in a bad humour, but I did not pay much
attention to it. I even, whilst waiting till her rubber was
finished, talked quite gaily to Madame de Merteuil, who
had supped here, and we spoke much of Danceny. I do
not believe, however, that we were overheard. She went
away and I retired to my room.</p>

<p>I was undressing when Mamma entered, and I sent
away my maid; she asked me for the key of my
desk. The tone in which she made this request caused
me to tremble so that I could hardly stand. I made
a pretence of being unable to find it; but at last I had
to obey her. The first drawer which she opened was precisely
that which contained the letters of the Chevalier
Danceny. I was so confused that, when she asked me
what it was, I did not know what to reply to her, except
that it was nothing; but when I saw her begin to read
the first which presented itself, I had barely time to sink into
an arm-chair when I felt so ill that I swooned away.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
As soon as I came to myself again, my mother, who had
called my maid, withdrew, telling me to go to bed. She
carried off all Danceny’s letters. I tremble every time I
reflect that I must appear before her again. I did naught
but weep all the night through.</p>

<p>I write to you at dawn, in the hope that Joséphine will
come. If I can speak with her alone, I shall ask her to
take a short note I am going to write to Madame de
Merteuil; if not, I will put it in your letter, and will you
kindly send it, as if from yourself. It is only from her
that I shall get any consolation. At least, we can speak
of him, for I have no hope to see him again. I am very
wretched! Perhaps she will be kind enough to take
charge of a letter for Danceny. I dare not trust Joséphine
for such a purpose, and still less my maid; for it is
perhaps she who told my mother that I had letters in
my desk.</p>

<p>I will not write to you at any greater length, because I
wish to have time to write to Madame de Merteuil and
also to Danceny, to have my letter all ready, if she will
take charge of it. After that I shall lie down again, so
that they will find me in bed when they come into my
room. I shall say that I am ill, so that I need not have to
visit Mamma. It will not be a great falsehood: for indeed
I suffer more than if I had the fever. My eyes burn
from excessive weeping; and I have a weight on my chest
which hinders me from breathing. When I think that I
shall not see Danceny again, I wish that I were dead.</p>

<p>Adieu, my dear Sophie, I can say no more to you; my
tears choke me.</p>

<br><small>MADAME DE VOLANGES TO THE CHEVALIER DANCENY</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">After</span> having abused, Monsieur, a mother’s confidence
and the innocence of a child, you will doubtless not be
surprised if you are no longer received in a house where
you have responded to the marks of a most sincere
friendship, by a forgetfulness of all that is fitting. I prefer to
beg you not to call upon me again, than to give orders
at the door, which would compromise all alike, by
the remarks which the lackeys would not fail to make.
I have a right to hope that you will not force me to
have recourse to such a means. I warn you also that if
you make in future the least attempt to support my
daughter in the folly into which you have beguiled her,
an austere and eternal retreat shall shelter her from your
pursuit. It is for you to decide, Monsieur, whether you
will shrink as little from being the cause of her misery,
as you have from attempting her dishonour. As for me,
my choice is made, and I have acquainted her with it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span></p>

<p>You will find enclosed the packet containing your letters.
I reckon upon you to send me in return all those of
my daughter, and to do your utmost to leave no trace
of an incident the memory of which I could not retain
without indignation, she without shame, and you without
remorse.</p>

<p>I have the honour to be, etc.</p>

<br><small>THE MARQUISE DE MERTEUIL TO THE VICOMTE DE VALMONT</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">Indeed</span>, yes, I will explain Danceny’s letter to you. The
incident which caused him to write it is my handiwork,
and it is, I think, my <i>chef-d’œuvre</i>. I wasted no time
since your last letter, and I said with the Athenian
architect, “What he has said, I will do.”</p>

<p>It is obstacles then that this fine hero of romance
needs, and he slumbers in felicity! Oh, let him look
to me, I will give him some work: and if his slumber
is going to be peaceful any longer, I am mistaken.
Indeed, he had to be taught the value of time, and I
flatter myself that by now he is regretting all he has lost.
It were well also, said you, that he had need of more
mystery: well, that need won’t be lacking him now. I have
this quality, I—that my mistakes have only to be pointed
out to me; then I take no repose until I have retrieved
them. Let me tell you now what I did.</p>

<p>When I returned home in the morning of the day before
yesterday, I read your letter; I found it luminous. Convinced
that you had put your finger on the cause of the evil, my
sole concern now was to find a means of curing it. I
commenced, however, by retiring to bed; for the indefatigable
Chevalier had not let me sleep a moment, and I thought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
I was sleepy: but not at all; absorbed in Danceny, my
desire to cure him of his indolence, or to punish him for
it, did not let me close an eye, and it was only after I
had thoroughly completed my plan, that I could take
two hours’ rest.</p>

<p>I went that same evening to Madame de Volanges, and,
according to my project, I told her confidentially that I
felt sure a dangerous intimacy existed between her daughter
and Danceny. This woman, who sees so clearly in
your case, was so blind that she answered me at first
that I was certainly mistaken, that her daughter was a
child, etc., etc. I could not tell her all I knew; but
I quoted certain looks and remarks <i>whereat my virtue and
my friendship had taken alarm</i>. In short, I spoke almost as
well as a <i>dévote</i> would have done; and to strike the decisive
blow, I went so far as to say that I thought I had seen
a letter given and received. “That reminds me,” I added,
“one day she opened before me a drawer in her desk
in which I saw a number of papers, which she doubtless
preserves. Do you know if she has any frequent correspondence?”
Here Madame de Volanges’ face changed,
and I saw some tears rise to her eyes. “I thank you, my
kind friend,” she said, as she pressed my hand; “I will
clear this up.”</p>

<p>After this conversation, which was too short to excite
suspicion, I went over to the young person. I left her
soon afterwards, to beg her mother not to compromise me
in her daughter’s eyes; she promised me this the more
willingly, when I pointed out to her how fortunate it would
be if the child were to take sufficient confidence in me
to open her heart to me, and thus afford me the occasion
of giving her <i>my wise counsels</i>. I feel certain that she will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
keep her promise, because she will doubtless seek to vaunt
her penetration in her daughter’s eyes. Thus I am
authorized to maintain my friendly tone towards the child,
without seeming false to Madame de Volanges, which I
wished to avoid. I have also gained for the future the
right to be as long and as privately as I like with the
young person, without the mother being able to take
umbrage.</p>

<p>I took advantage of this, that very evening; and when
my game was over, I took the child aside in a corner,
and set her on the subject of Danceny, upon which
she is inexhaustible. I amused myself by exciting her
with the pleasure she will have when she sees him
to-morrow; there is no kind of folly that I did not make
her say. I needs must restore to her in hope what I
had deprived her of in reality; and besides all that ought
to render the blow more forcible, and I am persuaded
that, the more she suffers, the greater will be her haste to
compensate herself for it, on the next occasion. ’Tis wise,
moreover, to accustom to great events anyone whom one
destines for great adventures.</p>

<p>After all, may she not pay for the pleasure of having
her Danceny with a few tears? She dotes on him!
Well, I promise her that she shall have him, and even
sooner than she would have done, but for this storm. It
is like a bad dream, the awakening from which will be
delicious; and, considering all, I think she owes me gratitude:
after all, if I have put a spice of malice into it, one must
amuse oneself:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>“Les sots sont ici-bas pour nos menus-plaisirs.”</i><a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span></p>

<p>I withdrew at last, thoroughly satisfied with myself.
Either, said I to myself, Danceny’s love, excited by obstacles,
will redouble in intensity, and then I shall serve him with
all my power; or, if he is nothing but a fool, as I am
sometimes tempted to believe, he will be in despair, and
will look upon himself as beaten: now, in that case, I
shall at least have been as well avenged on him as he
has been on me; on my way, I shall have increased the
mother’s esteem for me, the daughter’s friendship, and the
confidence of both. As for Gercourt, the first object of
my care, I should be very unlucky, or very clumsy, if,
mistress over his bride’s mind, as I am, and as I intend to
be even more, I did not find a thousand ways of making
him what I mean him to be. I went to bed with these
pleasant thoughts: I slept well, too, and awoke very
late.</p>

<p>On my awakening I found two letters, one from the
mother and one from the daughter; and I could not
refrain from laughing when I encountered, in both, literally
this same phrase: “<i>It is from you alone that I expect
any consolation.</i>” Is it not amusing to console for and
against, and to be the single agent of two directly contrary
interests? Behold me, like the Divinity, receiving
the diverse petitions of blind mortals, and altering nothing
in my immutable decrees. I have deserted that august
part, however, to assume that of the consoling angel; and
have been, as the precept bids us, to visit my friends in
their affliction.</p>

<p>I began with the mother; I found her wrapped in a
sadness which already avenges you in part for the
obstacles she has thrown in your way, on the side of your
fair prude. Everything has succeeded marvellously, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
my only anxiety was lest Madame de Volanges should
take advantage of the moment to gain her daughter’s
confidence: which would have been quite easy, had she
employed with her the language of kindness and affection,
and given to reasonable counsels the air and tone of indulgent
tenderness. Luckily she had armed herself with severity;
in short, she had behaved so unwisely that I could only
applaud. It is true that she thought of frustrating all our
schemes, by the course which she had resolved on of
sending her daughter back to the convent: but I warded
off this blow, and induced her merely to make a threat
of it, in the event of Danceny continuing his pursuit;
this in order to compel both to a circumspection which
I believe necessary to success.</p>

<p>I next went to the daughter. You would not believe
how grief improves her! If she does but take to coquetry,
I warrant that she will be often weeping; but this
time she wept in all sincerity.... Struck by this new
charm, which I had not known in her, and which I was
very pleased to observe, I gave her at first but clumsy
consolations, which rather increased her sorrow than
assuaged it; and by this means I brought her well nigh to
choking-point. She wept no more, and for a moment I
was afraid of convulsions. I advised her to go to bed, to
which she agreed; I served her for waiting-maid: she
had made no toilette, and soon her dishevelled hair was
falling over her shoulders and bosom, which were entirely
bare; I embraced her; she abandoned herself in my arms,
and her tears began to flow again without an effort.
Lord! how beautiful she was! Ah, if the Magdalen was
like that, she must have been far more dangerous in her
penitence than when she sinned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span></p>

<p>When the disconsolate fair one was in bed, I started
to console her in good faith. I first reassured her as to
her fear about the convent. I excited a hope in her of
seeing Danceny in secret; and sitting upon the bed: “If
<i>he</i> was here,” said I; then, embroidering on this theme,
I led her from distraction to distraction, until she had
quite forgotten her affliction. We should have separated
in a complete satisfaction with one another, if she had
not wished to charge me with a letter to Danceny; which
I consistently refused. Here are my reasons for this,
which you will doubtless approve:</p>

<p>To begin with, it would have been to compromise
myself openly with Danceny; and though this was the only
reason I could employ with the little one, there are plenty
of others which hold between you and me. Would it
not have been to risk the fruit of my labours to give
our young people so soon a means so easy of lightening
their pains? And then, I should not be sorry to compel
them to introduce some servants into this adventure;
for, if it is to work out well, which is what I hope for,
it must become known immediately after the marriage, and
there are few surer methods of publishing it. Or if, by
a miracle, the servants were not to speak, we would
speak ourselves, and it will be more convenient to lay
the indiscretion to their account.</p>

<p>You must give this idea, then, to-day to Danceny; and
as I am not sure of the waiting-maid of the little Volanges,
and she seems to distrust her herself, suggest my own
to him, my faithful Victoire. I will take care that the
enterprise is successful. This idea pleases me all the
more, as the confidence will only be useful to us and
not to them: for I am not at the end of my story.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span></p>

<p>Whilst I was excusing myself from carrying the child’s
letter, I was afraid every moment that she would suggest
that I should send it by the post, which I could hardly
have refused to do. Luckily, either in her confusion
or in her ignorance, or again because she was less set
on her letter than on a reply to it, which she could not
have obtained by this means, she did not speak of it to
me; but, to prevent this idea coming to her, or at least
her being able to use it, I made up my mind on the spot;
and on returning to her mother, persuaded her to send
her daughter away for some time, to take her to the
country.... And where? Does not your heart beat with
joy?... To your Aunt, to the old Rosemonde. She
is to apprise her of it to-day; so, behold you authorized
to return to your Puritan, who will no longer be able to
reproach you with the scandal of a <i>tête-à-tête</i>; and thanks
to my pains, Madame de Volanges will herself repair the
wrong she had done you.</p>

<p>But listen to me, and do not be so constantly wrapped
up in your own affairs as to lose sight of this one;
remember that I am interested in it. I want you to
become the go-between and counsellor of the two young
people. Inform Danceny of this journey and offer him
your services. Find no difficulty, except as to getting your
letter of credit into the fair one’s hands; and demolish
this obstacle on the spot by suggesting to him the services
of my waiting-maid. There is no doubt but that he will
accept; and you will have, as reward for your trouble, the
confidence of a young heart, which is always interesting.
Poor child, how she will blush when she hands you her
first letter! In truth, this <i>rôle</i> of confidant, against which
a sort of prejudice has grown up, seems to me a very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
pretty relaxation, when you are occupied elsewhere; and
that is the case in which you will be.</p>

<p>It is upon your attention that the <i>dénouement</i> of this
intrigue will depend. Judge the moment when the actors
must be reunited. The country offers a thousand ways;
and Danceny cannot fail to be ready at your first signal.
A night, a disguise, a window ... what do I know?
But mark me, if the little girl comes back as she went away,
I shall quarrel with you. If you consider that she has
need of any encouragement from me, send word to me.
I think I have given her such a good lesson on the
danger of keeping letters, that I may venture to write to
her now; and I still cherish the design of making her my
pupil.</p>

<p>I believe I forgot to tell you that her suspicions with
regard to the surprised correspondence fell at first upon
her waiting-maid, but that I turned them towards the
confessor. That was a way of killing two birds with one
stone.</p>

<p>Adieu, Vicomte, I have been writing to you a long
time now, and my dinner is the later for it: but self-love
and friendship dictated my letter, and both are garrulous.
For the rest, it will be with you by three o’clock, and
that is all you need.</p>

<p>Pity me now, if you dare; and go and visit the woods
of the Comte de B***, if they tempt you. You say
that he keeps them for the pleasure of his friends! Is
the man a friend of all the world then? But adieu, I
am hungry.</p>

<br><small>THE CHEVALIER DANCENY TO MADAME DE VOLANGES</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="center">(A draft enclosed in letter the <a href="#LETTER_THE_SIXTY-SIXTH">sixty-sixth</a>, from the Vicomte
to the Marquise)</p>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">Without</span> seeking, Madame, to justify my conduct, and
without complaining of yours, I cannot but grieve at an
event which brings unhappiness to three persons, all
three worthier of a happier fate. More sensible to the
grief of being the cause of it than even to that of being
its victim, I have tried frequently, since yesterday, to have
the honour to write to you, without being able to find
the strength. I have, however, so many things to say to
you that I must make a great effort over myself; and if
this letter has little order and sequence, you must be
sufficiently sensible of my painful situation to grant me
some indulgence.</p>

<p>Permit me, first, to protest against the first sentence of
your letter. I venture to say that I have abused neither
your confidence nor the innocence of Mademoiselle de
Volanges; in my actions I respected both. These alone
depended on me; and when you would render me responsible
for an involuntary sentiment, I am not afraid to add
that that which Mademoiselle your daughter has inspired
in me is of a kind which may be displeasing to you but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
cannot offend you. Upon this subject, which touches me
more than I can say, I wish for no other judge than
you, and my letters for my witnesses.</p>

<p>You forbid me to present myself at your house in
future, and doubtless I shall submit to everything which
it shall please you to order on this subject: but will
not this sudden and total absence give as much cause
for the remarks which you would avoid as the order which,
for that very same reason, you did not wish to leave at
your door? I insist all the more on this point, in that
it is far more important for Mademoiselle de Volanges
than for me. I beg you then to weigh everything attentively,
and not to permit your severity to lessen your prudence.
Persuaded that the simple interest of Mademoiselle your
daughter will dictate your resolves, I shall await fresh
orders from you.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in case you should permit me to pay you
my court sometimes, I undertake, Madame (and you
can count on my promise), not to abuse the opportunity
by attempting to speak privately with Mademoiselle de
Volanges, or to send any letter to her. The fear of
compromising her reputation decides me to this sacrifice;
and the happiness of sometimes seeing her will be my
reward.</p>

<p>This paragraph of my letter is also the only reply that
I can make to what you tell me as to the fate you
reserve for Mademoiselle de Volanges, and which you
would make dependent on my conduct. I should deceive
you were I to promise you more. A vile seducer can
adapt his plans to circumstances, and calculate upon
events; but the love which animates me permits me only
two sentiments, courage and constancy. What, I!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
consent to be forgotten by Mademoiselle de Volanges, to
forget her myself! No, no, never! I will be faithful to
her, she has received my vow, and I renew it this day.
Forgive me, Madame, I am losing myself, I must return.</p>

<p>There remains one other matter to discuss with you; that
of the letters which you demand from me. I am truly
pained to have to add a refusal to the wrongs which you
already accuse me of: but I beg you, listen to my reasons,
and deign to remember, in order to appreciate them, that
the only consolation of my unhappiness at having lost
your friendship is the hope of retaining your esteem.</p>

<p>The letters of Mademoiselle de Volanges, always so
precious to me, have become doubly so at present. They
are the solitary good thing which remains to me; they
alone retrace for me a sentiment which is all the charm
of life to me. However, you may believe me, I should
not hesitate an instant in making the sacrifice, and my
regret at being deprived of them would yield to my
desire of proving to you my respectful deference; but
considerations more powerful restrain me, and I assure
you that you yourself cannot blame me for them.</p>

<p>You have, it is true, the secret of Mademoiselle de Volanges;
but permit me to say that I am authorized to believe
it is the result of surprise and not of confidence. I
do not pretend to blame a proceeding which is, perhaps,
authorized by maternal solicitude. I respect your rights,
but they do not extend so far as to dispense me from my
duties. The most sacred of all is never to betray the
confidence which is entrusted to you. It would be to fail
in this to expose to the eyes of another the secrets of a
heart which did but wish to reveal them to mine. If
Mademoiselle your daughter consents to confide them to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
you, let her speak; her letters are of no use to you. If
she wishes, on the contrary, to lock her secret within herself,
you doubtless cannot expect me to be the person to
instruct you.</p>

<p>As for the mystery in which you desire this incident to
be buried, rest assured, Madame, that, in all that
concerns Mademoiselle de Volanges, I can rival even a
mother’s heart. To complete my work of removing all
cause for anxiety from you, I have foreseen everything.
This precious deposit, which bore hitherto the inscription:
<i>Papers to be burned</i>, carries now the words: <i>Papers belonging
to Madame de Volanges</i>. The course which I have
taken should prove to you also that my refusal does not
refer to any fear that you might find in these letters one
single sentiment with which you could personally find
fault.</p>

<p>This, Madame, is indeed a long letter. It will not have
been long enough, if it leaves you the least doubt as to
the honesty of my sentiments, my very sincere regret at
having displeased you, and the profound respect with
which I have the honour to be, etc.</p>

<br><small>THE CHEVALIER DANCENY TO CÉCILE VOLANGES</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="center">(Sent open to the Marquise de Merteuil in letter the <a href="#LETTER_THE_SIXTY-SIXTH">sixty-sixth</a>
from the Vicomte)</p>

<p class="noin">O <span class="smcap">my</span> Cécile! what is to become of us? What God
will save us from the misfortunes which threaten us? Let
love, at least, give us the courage to support them! How
can I paint for you my astonishment, my despair, at the
sight of my letters, at the reading of Madame de Volanges’
missive? Who can have betrayed us? On whom do your
suspicions fall? Could you have committed any imprudence?
What are you doing now? What have they said to you?
I would know everything, and I am ignorant of all.
Perhaps, you yourself are no better informed than I.</p>

<p>I send you your Mamma’s note and a copy of my reply.
I hope that you will approve of what I have said. I need
also your approval of all the measures I have taken since
this fatal event; they are all with the object of having
news of you, of giving you mine; and, who knows?
perhaps of seeing you again, and more freely than ever.</p>

<p>Imagine, my Cécile, the pleasure of finding ourselves
together again, of being able to seal anew our vows of
eternal love, and of seeing in our eyes, of feeling in our
souls, that this vow will not be falsified! What pain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
will not so sweet a moment make us forget! Ah, well,
I have hope of seeing it arrive, and I owe it to these
same measures which I beg you to approve. What am I
saying? I owe it to the consoling care of the most
tender of friends; and my sole request is that you will
permit this friend to become also your own.</p>

<p>Perhaps, I ought not to have given your confidence
away without your consent; but I had misfortune and
necessity for my excuse. It is love which has guided
me; it is that which claims your indulgence, which begs
you to pardon a confidence that was necessary, and without
which we should, perhaps, have been separated for ever.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
You know the friend of whom I speak: he is the friend
of the woman whom you love best. It is the Vicomte
de Valmont.</p>

<p>My plan in addressing him was, at first, to beg him
to induce Madame de Merteuil to take charge of a letter
for you. He did not think this method could succeed, but,
in default of the mistress, he answered for the maid,
who was under obligations to him. It is she who will
give you this letter; and you can give her your reply.</p>

<p>This assistance will hardly be of use to us, if, as M. de
Valmont believes, you leave immediately for the country.
But then it will be he himself who will serve us. The
lady to whom you are going is his kinswoman. He
will take advantage of this pretext to repair thither at the
same time that you do; and it will be through him that
our mutual correspondence will pass. He assures me, even,
that if you will let yourself be guided by him, he will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
procure us the means of meeting, without your running
the risk of being in any way compromised.</p>

<p>Now, my Cécile, if you love me, if you pity my misery,
if, as I hope, you share my regret, will you refuse
your confidence to a man who will become our guardian
angel? Without him, I should be reduced to the despair
of being unable even to alleviate the grief I have caused
you. It will finish, I hope: but promise me, my tender
friend, not to abandon yourself overmuch to it, not to
let it break you down. The idea of your grief is insupportable
torture to me. I would give my life to make
you happy! You know that well. May the certainty
that you are adored carry some consolation to your
soul! Mine has need of your assurance that you pardon
love for the ills it has made you suffer.</p>

<p>Adieu, my Cécile, adieu, my tender love!</p>

<br><small>THE VICOMTE DE VALMONT TO THE MARQUISE DE
MERTEUIL</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">You</span> will see, my lovely friend, by a perusal of the two
enclosed letters, whether I have well fulfilled your project.
Although both are dated to-day, they were written yesterday
at my house, and beneath my eyes; that to the little
girl says all that we wanted. One can but humble one’s
self before the profundity of your views, when one judges
of it by the success of your measures. Danceny is all on
fire; and assuredly, at the first opportunity, you will have
no more reproaches to make him. If his fair <i>ingénue</i> choose
to be tractable, all will be finished a short time after
her arrival in the country; I have a hundred methods all
prepared. Thanks to your care, behold me decidedly <i>the
friend of Danceny</i>; it only remains for him to become <i>Prince</i>.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>He is still very young, this Danceny! Would you
believe it, I have never been able to prevail on him to
promise the mother to renounce his love; as if there were
much hindrance in a promise, when one is determined
not to keep it! It would be deceit, he kept on repeating
to me: is not this scruple edifying, especially in the would-be
seducer of the daughter? That is so like men! all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
equally rascally in their designs, the weakness they display
in the execution they christen probity.</p>

<p>It is your affair to prevent Madame de Volanges from
taking alarm at the little sallies which our young man has
permitted himself in his letter; preserve us from the
convent; try also to make her abandon her request for
the child’s letters. To begin with, he will not give them
up, and I am of his opinion; here love and reason are
in accord. I have read them, these letters; I have assimilated
the tedium of them. They may become useful.
I will explain.</p>

<p>In spite of the prudence which we shall employ, there may
arise a scandal; this would break off the marriage, would
it not? and spoil all our Gercourt projects. But, as on
my side I have to be revenged on the mother, I reserve
for myself in such a case the daughter’s dishonour. By
selecting carefully from this correspondence, and producing
only a part of it, the little Volanges would appear to
have made all the first overtures, and to have absolutely
thrown herself at his head. Some of the letters would
even compromise the mother, and would, at any rate,
convict her of unpardonable negligence. I am quite aware
that the scrupulous Danceny would revolt against this at
first; but, as he would be personally attacked, I think he
would be open to reason. It is a thousand chances to
one that things will not turn out so; but one must foresee
everything.</p>

<p>Adieu, my lovely friend: it would be very amiable
of you to come and sup to-morrow at the Maréchale
de ***’s; I could not refuse.</p>

<p>I presume I have no need to recommend you secrecy,
as regards Madame de Volanges, upon my country project.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
She would at once decide to stay in Town: whereas, once
arrived there, she will not start off again the next day;
and, if she only gives us a week, I answer for everything.</p>

<br><small>THE PRÉSIDENTE DE TOURVEL TO THE VICOMTE DE VALMONT</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="noin">I <span class="smcap">did</span> not mean to answer you again, Monsieur, and,
perhaps, the embarrassment I feel at the present moment
is itself an effectual proof that I ought not. However, I
would not leave you any cause of complaint against me;
I wish to convince you that I have done for you everything
I could.</p>

<p>I permitted you to write to me, you say? I agree;
but when you remind me of that permission, do you
think I forget on what conditions it was given? If I
had been as faithful as you have proved the reverse,
would you have received a single reply from me? This
is, however, the third; and when you do all that in you
lies to compel me to break off this correspondence, it is
I who am busy with the means of continuing it. There
is one, but only one; and if you refuse to take it, it will
prove to me, whatever you may say, how little value you
set upon it.</p>

<p>Forsake, then, a language to which I may not and
will not listen; renounce a sentiment which offends and
alarms me, and to which you would perhaps be less
attached, if you reflected that it is the obstacle which
separates us. Is this sentiment the only one, then,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
that you can understand? And must love have this
one fault the more in my eyes, that it excludes friendship?
Would you yourself be so wrong as not to wish for your
friend her in whom you have desired more tender sentiments?
I would not believe it: that humiliating idea
would revolt me, would divide me from you without hope
of return.</p>

<p>In offering you my friendship, Monsieur, I give you
all that is mine to give, all of which I can dispose.
What can you desire more? To give way to this sentiment,
so gentle, so suited to my heart, I only await your
assent and the word which I ask of you, that this friendship
will suffice for your happiness. I will forget all that I
may have been told; I will trust in you to be at the
pains of justifying my choice.</p>

<p>You see my frankness; it should prove to you my
confidence; it will rest with you only, if it is to be
further augmented: but I warn you that the first word
of love destroys it for ever, and restores to me all my
fears; above all, that it will become the signal for
my eternal silence with regard to you.</p>

<p>If, as you say, you have turned away from your errors,
will you not rather be the object of a virtuous woman’s
friendship than of a guilty woman’s remorse? Adieu,
Monsieur; you feel that, after having spoken thus, I can
say nothing more until you have replied to me.</p>

<br><small>THE VICOMTE DE VALMONT TO THE PRÉSIDENTE DE TOURVEL</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">How</span>, Madame, am I to answer your last letter? How
dare be true, when my sincerity may ruin my cause with
you? No matter, I must; I will have the courage. I
tell myself, I repeat to myself, that it is better to deserve
you than to obtain you: and, must you deny me for ever
a happiness that I shall never cease to desire, I must at
least prove to you that my heart is worthy of it.</p>

<p>What a pity, that, as you say, I have <i>turned away
from my errors!</i> With what transports of joy I should
have read that same letter, to which I tremble to-day
to reply. You speak to me therein with <i>frankness</i>, you
display me <i>confidence</i>, and you offer me your <i>friendship</i>:
what good things, Madame, and how I regret that I can
not profit by them! Why am I no longer what I was?</p>

<p>If I were, indeed, if I felt for you only an ordinary
fancy, that light fancy which is the child of seduction
and pleasure, which to-day, however, is christened love, I
should hasten to extract advantage from all that I could
obtain. With scant delicacy as to means, provided that
they procured me success, I should encourage your frankness
from my need of finding you out; I should desire your
confidence with the design of betraying it; I should accept<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
your friendship with the hope of beguiling it.... What,
Madame! does this picture alarm you?... Ah, well, it
would be a true picture of me, were I to tell you that I
consented to be no more than your friend.</p>

<p>What, I! I consent to share with any one a sentiment
which has emanated from your soul! If I ever tell you
so, do not believe me. From that moment I should seek
to deceive you; I might desire you still, but I should
assuredly love you no longer.</p>

<p>It is not that amiable frankness, sweet confidence, sensible
friendship are without value in my eyes.... But love!
True love, and such as you inspire, by uniting all these
sentiments, by giving them more energy, would not know
how to lend itself, like them, to that tranquillity, to that
coldness of soul, which permits comparisons, which even
suffers preferences. No, Madame, I will not be your
friend; I will love you with the most tender, even the most
ardent love, although the most respectful. You can drive
it to despair, but you cannot annihilate it.</p>

<p>By what right do you pretend to dispose of a heart
whose homage you refuse? By what refinement of
cruelty do you rob me of even the happiness of loving
you? That happiness is mine; it is independent of you;
I shall know how to defend it. If it is the source of my
ills, it is also their remedy.</p>

<p>No, once more, no. Persist in your cruel refusals,
but leave me my love. You take pleasure in making
me unhappy! ah, well! be it so, endeavour to wear
out my courage, I shall know how to force you at
least to decide my fate; and perhaps some day you will
render me more justice. It is not that I hope ever to
make you susceptible: but, without being persuaded,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
you will be convinced; you will say to yourself: I judged
him ill.</p>

<p>To put it rightly, it is to yourself that you are unjust.
To know you without loving you, to love you without
being constant, are two things which are equally impossible;
and, in spite of the modesty which adorns you, it must
be easier for you to feel pity than surprise at the sentiments
which you arouse. For me, whose only merit is
that I have known how to appreciate you, I will not lose
that; and far from accepting your insidious offers, I renew
at your feet my vow to love you always.</p>

My mother no longer speaks to me; she has taken pens,

you have done; I love you too well not to take every

I did not like M. de Valmont, and I did not know he
was so great a friend of yours; I will try to get used to
him, and I will love him for your sake. I do not know
who it is that has betrayed us; it can only be my waiting-maid
or my confessor. I am very miserable: we are going

<br><small>THE VICOMTE DE VALMONT TO THE MARQUISE DE MERTEUIL</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="noin">I <span class="smcap">have</span> an important warning to give you, my dear friend.
As you know, I supped yesterday with the Maréchale
de ***: you were spoken of, and I said, not all the good
which I think, but all that which I do not think. Everyone
appeared to be of my opinion, and the conversation
languished, as ever happens when one says only good of
one’s neighbour, when a voice was raised in contradiction:
it was Prévan’s.</p>

<p>“Heaven forbid,” he said, rising, “that I should doubt
the virtue of Madame de Merteuil! But I would dare
believe that she owes it more to her lightness of character
than to her principles. It is perhaps more difficult to
follow her than to please her; and, as one rarely fails, when
one runs after a woman, to meet others on the way;
as, after all, these others may be as good as she is, or
better; some are distracted by a fresh fancy, others stop
short from lassitude; and she is, perhaps, the woman in
all Paris who has had least cause to defend herself. As
for me,” he added, encouraged by the smile of some of
the women, “I shall not believe in Madame de Merteuil’s
virtue, until I have killed six horses in paying my court
to her.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span></p>

<p>This ill-natured joke succeeded, as do all those which
savour of scandal; and, during the laugh which it excited,
Prévan resumed his place, and the general conversation
changed. But the two Comtesses de B***, by the side
of whom our sceptic sat, had a private conversation
with him, which luckily I was in a position to overhear.</p>

<p>The challenge to render you susceptible was accepted;
word was pledged that everything was to be told: and of
all the pledges that might be given in this adventure, this
one should assuredly be the most religiously kept. But
there you are, forewarned, and you know the proverb.</p>

<p>It remains for me to tell you that this Prévan, whom
you do not know, is infinitely amiable, and even more
adroit. If you have sometimes heard me declare the
contrary, it is only that I do not like him, that it is
my pleasure to thwart his success, and that I am not
ignorant of the weight of my suffrage with thirty or
so of our most fashionable women. In fact, I prevented
him for long, by this means, from appearing on what
we call the great scene; and he did prodigies, without
for that winning any more reputation. But the fame of
his triple adventure, by turning people’s eyes on him,
gave him that confidence which hitherto he had
lacked, and which has rendered him really formidable.
He is, in short, to-day perhaps the only man whom I
should fear to meet in my path; and, apart from your own
interest, you will be rendering me a real service by making
him appear ridiculous by the way. I leave him in good
hands, and I cherish the hope that, on my return, he will
be a ruined man.</p>

<p>I promise, in revenge, to carry through the adventure of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
your pupil, and to concern myself as much with her as
with my fair prude.</p>

<p>The latter has just sent me a letter of capitulation.
The whole letter announces her desire to be deceived.
It is impossible to suggest a method more time-worn or
more easy. She wishes me to become <i>her friend</i>. But I,
who love new and difficult methods, do not mean to cry quits
with her so cheaply; and I most certainly should not have
been at such pains with her, to conclude with an ordinary
seduction.</p>

<p>What I propose, on the contrary, is that she should feel,
and feel thoroughly, the value of each one of the sacrifices
she shall make me; not to lead her too swiftly for
remorse to follow her; to let her virtue expire in a slow
agony; to concentrate her, unceasingly, upon the heartbreaking
spectacle; and only to grant her the happiness
of having me in her arms, after compelling her no
longer to dissimulate her desire. In truth, I am of little
worth indeed, if I am not worth the trouble of asking for.
And can I take a less revenge for the haughtiness of a
woman who seems to blush to confess that she adores?</p>

<p>I have, therefore, refused the precious friendship, and
have held to my title of lover. As I do not deny that
this title, which seems at first no more than a verbal
quibble, is, however, of real importance to obtain, I have
taken a great deal of pains with my letter, and endeavoured
to be lavish of that disorder which alone can depict
sentiment. I have, in short, been as irrational as it was
possible for me to be: for, without one be irrational, there
is no tenderness; and it is for this reason, I believe, that
women are so much our superiors in love-letters.</p>

<p>I concluded mine with a piece of cajolery; and that is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
another result of my profound observation. After a
woman’s heart has been for some time exercised, it has
need of repose; and I have remarked that cajolery was,
to all, the softest pillow that could be offered.</p>

<p>Adieu, my lovely friend; I leave to-morrow. If you
have any commands to give me for the Comtesse de ***,
I will halt at her house, at any rate for dinner. I am
vexed to leave without seeing you. Send me your sublime
instructions, and aid me with your wise counsels, in this
critical moment.</p>

<p>Above all, defend yourself against Prévan; and grant that
I may make amends to you one day for the sacrifice!
Adieu.</p>

<br><small>THE VICOMTE DE VALMONT TO THE MARQUISE DE MERTEUIL</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">My</span> idiot of a <i>chasseur</i> has left my desk in Paris! My fair
one’s letters, those of Danceny to the little Volanges: all have
remained behind, and I have need of all. He is going
off to repair his stupidity; and whilst he is saddling his
horse, I will tell you my night’s story: for I beg you to
believe I do not waste my time.</p>

<p>The adventure in itself is but a small thing; a <i>réchauffé</i>
with the Vicomtesse de M***. But it interested me in its
details. I am delighted, moreover, to let you see that, if
I have a talent for ruining women, I have none the less,
when I wish it, that of saving them. The most difficult
course or the merriest is the one I choose; and I never
reproach myself for a good action, provided that it has kept
me in practice or amused me.</p>

<p>I found the Vicomtesse here, and as she joined her entreaties
to the persecutions with which they would make me pass the
night at the <i>château</i>: “Well, I consent,” I said to her, “on
condition that I pass it with you.” “That is impossible,”
she answered: “Vressac is here.” So far, I had but meant
to say the polite thing to her; but the word impossible revolted
me as usual. I felt humiliated at being sacrificed to Vressac,
and I resolved not to suffer it; I insisted therefore.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span></p>

<p>Circumstances were not favourable to me. This Vressac
had been awkward enough to give offence to the Vicomte;
so much so that the Vicomtesse can no longer receive him
at home, and this visit to the good Comtesse had been
arranged between them, in order to try and snatch a few
nights. The Vicomte had at first even shown signs of ill-humour
at meeting Vressac there; but, as his love of sport
is even stronger than his jealousy, he stayed none the
less: and the Comtesse, always the same as you know her,
after lodging the wife in the great corridor, put the husband
on one side and the lover on the other, and left them
to arrange things amongst themselves. The evil destiny of
both willed that I should be housed opposite them.</p>

<p>That very day, that is to say, yesterday, Vressac, who,
as you will well believe, cajoles the Vicomte, went out
shooting with him in spite of his distaste for sport, and
quite counted on consoling himself at night in the wife’s
arms for the <i>ennui</i> which the husband caused him all
day: but I judged that he would have need of repose,
and busied myself with the means of persuading his mistress
to give him the time to take it.</p>

<p>I succeeded, and persuaded her to pick a quarrel with
him concerning that very same shooting party to which,
very obviously, he had only consented for her sake. She
could not have chosen a more sorry pretext; but no
woman is better endowed than the Vicomtesse with that
talent, common to all women, of putting ill-humour in the
place of reason, and of being never so difficult to appease
as when she is in the wrong. Neither was the moment
convenient for explanations; and, as I only wished her for
one night, I consented to their reconciliation on the morrow.</p>

<p>Vressac was greeted sullenly on his return. He sought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
to demand the cause; he was abused. He tried to justify
himself; the husband, who was present, served for a pretext
to break off the conversation; finally, he attempted to take
advantage of a moment when the husband was absent, to
ask that she would be kind enough to listen to him that
night: it was then that the Vicomtesse became sublime.
She declaimed against the audacity of men who, because
they have experienced a woman’s favours, suppose that
they have the right to abuse her, even when she has
cause of complaint against him; and, having thus skilfully
changed the issue, she talked sentiment and delicacy so
well that Vressac grew dumb and confused, and I myself
was tempted to believe that she was right: for you must
know that, as a friend of both of them, I made a third at
this conversation.</p>

<p>In the end, she declared positively that she would not
add the fatigues of love to those of the chase, and that
she would reproach herself were she to disturb such sweet
pleasures. The husband returned. The disconsolate Vressac,
who was no longer at liberty to reply, addressed himself
to me; and, having, at great length, expounded his reasons,
which I knew as well as he, he begged me to speak to
the Vicomtesse, and I promised him to do so. I spoke
to her, in effect; but it was in order to thank her, and
to arrange the hour and manner of our <i>rendez-vous</i>.</p>

<p>She told me that, situated as she was between her
husband and her lover, she had thought it more prudent
to go to Vressac than to receive him in her apartment;
and that, since I was placed opposite her, she thought it
was safer also to come to me; that she would repair to my
room as soon as her waiting-maid had left her alone;
that I had only to leave my door ajar and await her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span></p>

<p>Everything was carried out as we had arranged; and
she came to my room about one o’clock in the morning,</p>

<p>As I am quite without vanity, I will not go into the
details of the night; but you know me, and I was satisfied
with myself.</p>

<p>At day-break, we had to separate. It is here that the
interest begins. The imprudent woman had thought to
have left her door ajar; we found it shut, and the key
was left inside. You have no idea of the expression of
despair, with which the Vicomtesse said to me at once:
“Ah, I am lost!” You must admit it would have been
amusing to have left her in this situation: but could I suffer
a woman to be ruined for me who had not been ruined by
me? And should I, like the commonalty of men, let myself
be overcome by circumstances? A method had to be
found therefore. What would you have done, my fair
friend? Hear what was my conduct; it was successful.</p>

<p>I soon realized that the door in question could be burst
in, on condition that one made a mighty amount of noise.
I persuaded the Vicomtesse, therefore, not without difficulty,
to utter some piercing cries of terror, such as <i>thieves,
murder</i>, etc., etc. And we arranged that, at the first cry,
I should break in the door, and she should rush to her
bed. You would not believe how much time it needed
to decide her, even after she had consented. However,
it had to be done that way, and at my first kick the door
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>yielded. The Vicomtesse did well not to lose time; for,
at the same instant, the Vicomte and Vressac were in the
corridor, and the waiting-maid had also run up to her
mistress’s chamber. I alone kept my coolness, and I
profited by it to go and extinguish a night-light which
still burned, for you can imagine how ridiculous it would
have been to feign this panic terror with a light in one’s
room. I then took husband and lover to task for their
sluggish sleep, assuring them that the cries, at which I
had run up, and my efforts to burst open the door, had
lasted at least five minutes.</p>

</div>
<div class="sync">&#160;</div>
<p>The Vicomtesse, who had regained her courage in bed,
seconded me well enough, and swore by all her gods that
there had been a thief in her chamber; she protested
with all the more sincerity in that she had never had
such a fright in her life. We searched everywhere and
found nothing, when I pointed to the overturned night-light,
and concluded that, without a doubt, a rat had
caused the damage and the alarm; my opinion was
accepted unanimously; and, after some well-worn pleasantries
on the subject of rats, the Vicomte was the first to
regain his chamber and his bed, praying his wife for the
future to keep her rats quieter.</p>

<p>Vressac, who was left alone with us, approached the
Vicomtesse to tell her tenderly that it was a vengeance
of Love; to which she answered, glancing at me, “He
was indeed angry then, for he has taken ample vengeance;
but,” she added, “I am exhausted with fatigue and I
want to sleep.”</p>

<p>I was in a good-humoured moment; consequently,
before we separated, I pleaded Vressac’s cause and
effected a reconciliation. The two lovers embraced, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
I, in my turn, was embraced by both. I had no more
relish for the kisses of the Vicomtesse; but I confess
that Vressac’s pleased me. We went out together; and
after I had accepted his lengthy thanks, we both betook
ourselves to bed.</p>

<p>If you find this history amusing, I do not ask you to
keep it secret. Now that I have had my amusement
out of it, it is but just that the public should have its turn.
For the moment, I am only speaking of the story; perhaps,
we shall soon say as much of the heroine.</p>

<p>Adieu! My <i>chasseur</i> has been waiting for an hour;
I take only the time to embrace you, and to recommend
you, above all, to beware of Prévan.</p>

<br><small>THE CHEVALIER DANCENY TO CÉCILE VOLANGES</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="center">(Not delivered until the 14th)</p>

<p class="noin">O <span class="smcap">my</span> Cécile! how I envy Valmont’s lot! To-morrow he
will see you: it is he who will give you this letter, and I,
languishing afar from you, must drag on my painful
existence betwixt unhappiness and regret. My friend, my
tender friend, pity my misfortunes; above all, pity me for
your own: it is in the face of them that my courage
deserts me.</p>

<p>How terrible it is to me that I should have caused
your misfortune! But for me, you would be happy and
tranquil. Can you forgive me? Ah, say, say that you
forgive me; tell me also that you love me, that you will
always love me. I need that you repeat it to me. It is
not that I doubt it: but it seems to me that, the more
sure I am of it, the sweeter it is to hear it said. You
love me, do you not? Yes, you love me with all your
soul. I do not forget that it is the last word I heard
you utter. How I have treasured it in my heart! How
deeply it is graven there! And with what transports has
not mine replied to it!</p>

<p>Alas, in that moment of happiness, I was far from foreseeing
the awful fate which awaited us! Let us occupy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
ourselves, my Cécile, with the means of alleviating it. If
I am to believe my friend, it will suffice, to attain this,
that you should treat him with the confidence which he
deserves.</p>

<p>I was grieved, I confess, at the unfavourable opinion
you appear to have had of him. I recognized there the
prejudices of your Mamma; it was to submit to them
that, for some time past, I had neglected that truly amiable
man, who to-day does everything for me; who, in short,
labours to reunite us, whom your Mamma has separated.
I implore you, my dear friend, look upon him with a
more favourable eye. Reflect that he is my friend, that
he wishes to be yours, that he can afford me the happiness
of seeing you. If these reasons do not convince you, my
Cécile, you do not love me as well as I love you, you
do not love me as much as you used to love me. Ah,
if ever you were to come to love me less! But no, the
heart of my Cécile is mine, it is mine for life; and if I
have to dread the pain of a love which is unfortunate,
her constancy will save me at least from the torments of
a love betrayed.</p>

<p>Adieu, my charming friend; do not forget how I suffer,
and that it only rests with you to make me happy, completely
happy. Hear my heart’s vow, and receive the
most tender kisses of love.</p>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">The</span> friend who serves you knows that you have no
writing materials, and he has already provided for this
want. You will find in the ante-room of the apartment
you occupy, beneath the great press, on the left-hand
side, a supply of pens, ink, and paper, which he will
renew when you require it, and which, so it seems to
him, you can leave in the same place, if you do not find
a surer one.</p>

<p>He asks you not to be offended with him, if he seems
to pay no attention to you in public, and only to regard
you as a child. This behaviour seems to him necessary,
in order to inspire the sense of security of which he has
need, and to enable him to work more effectively for his
friend’s happiness and your own. He will try to find
occasions for speaking with you, when he has anything
to tell you or give to you; and he hopes to succeed,
if you show any zeal to second him.</p>

<p>He also advises you to return to him, successively, the
letters which you may have received, in order that there
may be less risk of your compromising yourself.</p>

<p>He concludes by assuring you that, if you will give him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
your confidence, he will take every care to alleviate the
persecution that a too harsh mother is using against two
persons of whom one is already his best friend, whilst the
other seems to him worthy of the most tender interest.</p>

<br><small>THE MARQUISE DE MERTEUIL TO THE VICOMTE DE VALMONT</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">Ah</span>, since when, my friend, do you take alarm so easily?
Is this Prévan so very formidable then? But see how
simple and modest am I! I have often met him, this
haughty conqueror; I hardly looked at him! It required
nothing less than your letter to excite that amount of
attention from me. I repaired my injustice yesterday.
He was at the Opera, almost exactly opposite me, and
I took stock of him. He is handsome at any rate, yes,
very handsome: fine and delicate features! He must gain
by being seen close at hand. And you tell me he wants
to have me! Assuredly it will be my honour and pleasure.
Seriously, I have a fancy for it, and I now confide to you
that I have taken the first steps. I do not know if they
will succeed. Thus the matter stands.</p>

<p>He was not two paces off from me, as we came out
from the Opera, and I, very loudly, made an appointment
with the Marquise de *** to sup on Friday with the
Maréchale. It is, I think, the only house where I can
meet him. I have no doubt that he heard me.... If
the ungrateful fellow were not to come! But tell me, do
you think he will come? Do you know that, if he were
not to come, I should be in a bad humour all the evening?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
You see that he will not find so much difficulty in <i>following
me</i>; what will more astonish you is that he will have still
less in <i>pleasing me</i>. He would, he said, kill six horses in
paying his court to me! Oh, I will save those horses’
lives! I shall never have the patience to wait so long a
time. You know it is not one of my principles to leave
people languishing, when once I am decided; and I am
for him.</p>

<p>Please now confess that there is some pleasure in talking
reason to me! Has not your <i>important warning</i> been a
great success? But what would you have? I have been
vegetating for so long! It is more than six weeks since
I permitted myself a diversion. This one presents itself;
can I refuse myself it? Is not the object worth the trouble?
Is there any more agreeable, in whatever sense you take
the word?</p>

<p>You yourself are forced to do him justice; you do more
than praise him, you are jealous of him. Ah, well! I will
not set up as judge between the two of you; but, to begin
with, one should investigate, and that is what I want to
do. I shall be an impartial judge, and you shall both be
weighed in the same balance. As for you, I already have
your papers, and your affair is thoroughly enquired into.
Is it not only just that I should now occupy myself with
your adversary? Come now, yield with a good grace;
and as a commencement, let me hear, I beg you, what
is this triple adventure of which he is the hero. You
speak of it to me as though I knew of nothing else, and
I do not know the first word of it. Apparently, it must
have occurred during my expedition to Geneva, and your
jealousy prevented you from writing to me about it. Repair
this fault at the earliest possible; remember that <i>nothing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
which interests him is alien to me</i>. I certainly think that
they were still talking of it when I returned; but I was
otherwise occupied, and I rarely listen to anything of that
sort which is not the affair of to-day or of yesterday.</p>

<p>Even if what I ask of you should go somewhat against
the grain, is it not the least price you can pay for the
pains I have taken for you? Have these not sent you back
to your Présidente, when your blunders had separated you
from her? Was it not I, again, who put into your hands
the wherewithal to revenge yourself for the bitter zeal of
Madame de Volanges? You have complained so often
of the time you waste in searching after your adventures!
Now, you have them under your thumb. Betwixt love and
hate, you have but to choose; they both lie under the
same roof; and you can double your existence, caress
with one hand and strike with the other. It is even to me,
again, that you owe the adventure of the Vicomtesse. I
am quite satisfied with it; but, as you say, it must be
talked about; for if the situation could induce you, as I
conceive, to prefer for a moment mystery to <i>éclat</i>, it must
be admitted, none the less, that the woman did not merit
so honourable a procedure.</p>

<p>I have besides, cause of complaint against her. The
Chevalier de Belleroche finds her prettier than is to my
liking; and, for many reasons, I shall be glad to have a
pretext for breaking with her: now none is more convenient
than to be obliged to say: One cannot possibly know that
woman any longer.</p>

<p>Adieu, Vicomte; remember that, situated as you are, time
is precious; I shall employ mine by occupying myself with
Prévan’s happiness.</p>

<br><small>CÉCILE VOLANGES TO SOPHIE CARNAY</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="noin">[<i>N.B. In this letter, Cécile Volanges relates with the utmost
detail all that concerns her in the events which the Reader
already knows from the conclusion of the <a href="#LETTER_THE_FIFTY-NINTH">fifty-ninth</a> and
following letters. It seemed as well to suppress this repetition.
She finally speaks of the Vicomte de Valmont, and expresses
herself thus:</i>]</p>

<p>... I <span class="smcap">assure</span> you that he is a most remarkable man.
Mamma speaks mighty ill of him, but the Chevalier Danceny
says much in his favour, and I think that he is right. I
have never seen a man so clever. When he gave me
Danceny’s letter, it was in the midst of all the company,
and nobody saw anything of it: it is true I was terribly
frightened, because I had not expected anything; but now
I shall be prepared. I have already quite understood what
he wants me to do when I give him my answer. It is
very easy to understand him, because he has a look which
says anything he wants. I don’t know how he does it:
he told me in his note that he would appear not to take
any notice of me before Mamma; indeed, one would say,
all the time, that he never thinks of me, and yet, every
time I seek his eyes, I am sure to meet them at once.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span></p>

<p>There is a great friend of Mamma’s here, whom I did
not know, who also has the air of not loving M. de Valmont
too well, although he is full of attentions for her. I am
afraid that he will bore himself soon with the life one
leads here, and go back to Paris; that would be very
vexing. He must indeed have a good heart to have come
on purpose to do a service to his friend and me. I should
much like to show my gratitude to him, but I do not
know how to get speech with him; and when I find the
occasion, I should be so ashamed that, perhaps, I should
not know what to say to him.</p>

<p>It is only to Madame de Merteuil that I talk freely,
when I speak of my love. Perhaps, even with you, to
whom I tell everything, I should feel embarrassed if we
were talking. With Danceny himself, I have often felt,
as though in spite of myself, a certain alarm which prevented
me from telling him all that I thought. I reproach
myself greatly for this now, and I would give everything
in the world to find a moment to tell him once, only
once, how much I love him. M. de Valmont promised
him that, if I would be guided by him, he would contrive
an opportunity for us to see one another again. I will
certainly do everything he wants; but I cannot conceive
how it is possible. Adieu, my dear friend; I have no
more room left.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<br><small>THE VICOMTE DE VALMONT TO THE MARQUISE DE MERTEUIL</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">Either</span> your letter is a piece of banter which I have not
understood, or you were in a dangerous delirium when you
wrote it. If I knew you less well, my lovely friend, I should
truly be most alarmed; and, whatever you may say, I do
not take alarm too easily.</p>

<p>It is in vain that I read and re-read your letter, I
am none the more advanced; for to take it in the natural
sense which it presents is out of the question. What was
it then you wished to say? Is it merely that it was useless
to take so much trouble with an enemy who was so little
to be feared? In that case, you might be wrong. Prévan
is really attractive; he is more so than you believe; he
has, above all, the most useful talent of interesting people
greatly in his love, by the skill with which he will bring
it up in society, and before the company, by making use
of the first conversation which occurs. There are few
women who do not fall into the trap and reply to him,
because, all having pretensions to subtilty, none wishes to
lose an opportunity of displaying it. Now you are well
aware that the woman who consents to talk of love soon
finishes by feeling it, or at least by behaving as if she did.
He gains again at this method, which he has really brought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
to perfection, in that he can often call the women themselves
in testimony of their defeat; and this I tell you, as
one who has seen it.</p>

<p>I was never in the secret except at second-hand; for I
have never been intimate with Prévan: but, in a word, there
were six of us: and the Comtesse de P***, thinking
herself very artful all the time, and having the air indeed,
to any one who was not initiated, of conversing in the
abstract, told us, with the utmost detail, both how she had
succumbed to Prévan, and all that had passed between
them. She told this narrative with such a sense of security
that she was not even disturbed by a smile which came
over all our six faces at the same time; and I shall always
remember that one of us, having sought, by way of excuse,
to feign a doubt as to what she said, or rather of what
she had the air of saying, she answered gravely that we
were certainly, none of us, so well informed as she was;
and she was not afraid even to address herself to Prévan,
and ask him if she had said a word which was not
true.</p>

<p>I was right then in believing this man dangerous to
everybody: but for you, Marquise, was it not enough that
he was <i>handsome, very handsome</i>, as you tell me yourself?
Or that he should make <i>one of those attacks on you which
you sometimes amuse yourself by rewarding, for no other
reason than that you find them well contrived?</i> Or that
you should have found it amusing to succumb for any
reason whatever? Or—what do I know? Can I divine
the thousand and one caprices which govern a woman’s
head, and in which alone you continue to take after your sex?
Now that you are forewarned of the danger, I have no doubt
that you will easily avoid it: but it was none the less<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
necessary to forewarn you. I return to my text therefore:
what did you mean to say?</p>

<p>If it is only a piece of banter against Prévan, apart from
its being very long, it was of no use, addressed to me;
it is in society that he must suffer some excellent piece
of ridicule, and I renew my prayer to you on this subject.</p>

<p>Ah! I think I hold the key to the enigma! Your
letter is a prophecy, not of what you will do, but of what
he will think you ready to do, at the moment of the fall
which you have prepared for him. I quite approve of this
plan: it requires, however, great precautions. You know
as well as I do that, as far as the public is concerned,
to have a man or to receive his attentions is absolutely the
same thing, unless the man be a fool, which Prévan is
very far from being. If he can gain the appearances, he
will boast, and all will have been said. Fools will believe
him, the malicious will have the air of believing; where
will your resources be? Remember, I am afraid. It is
not that I doubt your skill: but it is the good swimmers
who get drowned.</p>

<p>I hold myself to be no duller than another: as for
means of dishonouring a woman, I have found a hundred,
I have found a thousand; but when I have busied myself
to seek how the woman could escape, I have never seen
the possibility. You yourself, my fair friend, whose conduct
is a masterpiece, I have a hundred times found you to
have had more good-luck than you have shown skill.</p>

<p>But, after all, I am, perhaps, seeking for a reason where
none exists. I am amazed, however, to think that, for
the last hour, I should have been treating seriously what
is surely a mere jest on your part. You intend to make
fun of me! Ah well! so be it; but make haste, and let<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
us speak of something else. Something else! I am
mistaken, it is always the same; always women to have
or to ruin, and often both.</p>

<p>I have here, as you remark, the wherewithal to exercise
myself in both kinds, but not with equal ease. I foresee
that vengeance will go quicker than love. The little
Volanges has succumbed, I answer for that; she only
awaits an opportunity, and I undertake to bring it about.
But it is not the same with Madame de Tourvel: this
woman is disheartening, I did not conceive it of her; I
have a hundred proofs of her love, but I have a thousand
of her resistance; and, in truth, I am afraid lest she
escape me.</p>

<p>The first effect which my return produced gave me more
hope. You will guess that I wished to judge for myself;
and, to make sure of seeing the first emotions, I sent no
one ahead to announce me, and I calculated my stages
so as to arrive when they should be at table. In fact, I
dropped from the clouds, like a divinity at the opera, who
comes to effect a <i>dénouement</i>.</p>

<p>Having made enough noise at my entry to attract all
eyes to me, I could see, in one glance, the joy of my old
aunt, the annoyance of Madame de Volanges and the
confused pleasure of her daughter. My fair one, owing to
the seat she occupied, had her back turned to the door.
Busy at the moment in carving something, she did not
even turn her head: but I said a word to Madame de
Rosemonde; and at the first sound, the sensitive Puritan,
recognizing my voice, uttered a cry in which I thought
I distinguished more love than terror or surprise. I
was then in a position to see her face; the tumult of
her soul, the struggle between her ideas and sentiments,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
were depicted on it in a score of different fashions. I sat
down to table by her side; she did not know precisely
anything of what she did or said. She endeavoured to go
on eating; it was out of the question: finally, not a quarter
of an hour later, her pleasure and confusion becoming
too strong for her, she could devise nothing better than
to ask permission to leave the table, and she escaped into
the park, on the pretext that she needed to take the air.
Madame de Volanges wanted to accompany her; the tender
prude would not permit it, too happy, no doubt, to have
a pretext for being alone, and to give way without constraint
to the soft emotion of her heart!</p>

<p>I made the dinner as short as it was possible to do.
Dessert was hardly served, when the infernal Volanges
woman, pressed apparently by her need to injure me, rose
from her seat to go and find the charming invalid: but I
had foreseen this project and I thwarted it. I feigned
therefore to take this particular movement for the general
signal; and, having risen at the same time, the little
Volanges and the <i>curé</i> of the place followed the double
example; so that Madame de Rosemonde was left alone
at the table with the old Commandant de T***; and
they also both decided to leave. We all went then to
rejoin my fair one, whom we found in the grove near the
<i>château</i>: as it was solitude she wanted and not a walk,
she was just as pleased to return with us as to make us
stay with her.</p>

<p>As soon as I was certain that Madame de Volanges
would have no opportunity to speak apart with her, I
thought of fulfilling your orders, and busied myself about
the interests of your pupil. Immediately after coffee, I
went up to my room, and went into the others also, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
explore the territory; I took measures to ensure the little
girl’s correspondence; after this first piece of benevolence,
I wrote a word of instruction to her and to beg for her
confidence; and I added my note to the letter from
Danceny. I returned to the <i>salon</i>. I found my beauty
reclining on a long chair, in an attitude of delicious
unconstraint.</p>

<p>This spectacle, whilst exciting my desires, illumined my
gaze; I felt that this must be tender and beseeching, and
I placed myself in such a position that I could bring it
into play. Its first effect was to cause the big, modest
eyes of the heavenly prude to be cast down. For some
time I considered that angelic face; then, glancing over
all her person, I amused myself by divining forms and
contours through the light clothing, which I could have
wished away. After having descended from head to feet,
I returned from feet to head.... My fair friend, her soft gaze
was fixed upon me; it was immediately lowered; but wishing
to promote its return, I averted my eyes. Then was
established between us that tacit convention, a first treaty
of bashful love, which, in order to satisfy the reciprocal
need of seeing, allows the looks to succeed one another,
until the moment comes when they are mingled.</p>

<p>Convinced that this new pleasure occupied my fair one
completely, I charged myself with the task of watching
over our common safety; but, having assured myself that
conversation was brisk enough to save us from the notice
of the company, I sought to obtain from her eyes that
they should frankly speak their language. For this, I began
by surprising certain glances, but with so much reserve that
modesty could not take alarm; and to put the bashful creature
more at her ease, I appeared to be as embarrassed as herself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span></p>

<p>Little by little our eyes, grown accustomed to encounter,
were fixed for a longer interval; until at last they quitted
each other no more, and I saw in hers that sweet languor
which is the happy signal of love and desire: but it was
only for a moment; soon recovering herself, she changed,
not without a certain shame, her attitude and her look.</p>

<p>Being unwilling that she should suspect I had observed
her different movements, I rose with vivacity, asking her,
with an air of alarm, if she were unwell. At once, everybody
rushed round her. I let them all pass in front of
me; and as the little Volanges, who was working at her
tapestry near a window, needed some time before she could
leave her task, I seized the moment to deliver Danceny’s
letter.</p>

<p>I was at a little distance from her; I threw the letter
into her lap. In truth she did not know what to do. You
would have laughed over much at her air of surprise and
embarrassment; however, I did not laugh, for I feared
lest so much clumsiness might betray us. But a quick
glance and gesture, strongly accentuated, gave her to understand
at last that she was to put the packet in her pocket.</p>

<p>The rest of the day contained nothing of interest. What
has passed since will, perhaps, bring about events with
which you will be pleased, at any rate in so far as your
pupil is concerned: but it is better to employ one’s time
in carrying out one’s projects than in describing them.
This is, moreover, the eighth sheet I have written, and I
am wearied; and so, adieu.</p>

<p>You will rightly suppose, without my telling it you, that
the child has replied to Danceny.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> I have also had a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
reply from my fair, to whom I wrote on the morrow of
my arrival. I send you the two letters. You will or you
will not read them: for this incessant, tedious repetition,
which already is none too amusing to me, must be insipid
indeed to any person not concerned.</p>

<p>Once more, adieu. I am ever mightily fond of you;
but I beg you, if you write to me of Prévan, do so in
such a manner that I may understand you.</p>

<br><small>THE VICOMTE DE VALMONT TO THE PRÉSIDENTE DE TOURVEL</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">Whence</span>, Madame, can arise the cruel pains which you
are at to shun me? How can it be that the most tender
zeal on my part meets on yours only with the treatment which
one would barely permit one’s self with the man against
whom one had the greatest cause to complain? What!
Love calls me back to your feet; and when a happy chance
places me at your side, you prefer to feign indisposition,
to alarm your friends, rather than consent to remain
near me! How many times, yesterday, did you not turn
away your eyes to deprive me of the favour of a glance!
And if for one single moment I was able to see less
severity there, that moment was so short that it seemed
as though you wished less to have me enjoy it than
to make me feel what I should lose by being deprived
of it.</p>

<p>That is not, I venture to say, either the treatment which
love deserves, or that which friendship may be allowed;
and yet, of these two sentiments, you know whether the one
does not animate me; and the other I was, it seems to
me, authorized to believe that you did not withhold. This
precious friendship, of which you doubtless thought me
worthy, since you were kind enough to offer it me—what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
have I done that I should lose it since? Could I have
damaged myself by my confidence, and will you punish
me for my frankness? At least, have you no fear lest
you abuse the one and the other? In effect, was it not
to the bosom of my friend that I entrusted the secret of
my heart? Was it not face to face with her alone that I
thought myself obliged to refuse conditions which I had
only to accept in order to obtain the facility for leaving them
unfulfilled, and perhaps of abusing them to my advantage?
Would you, in short, by a rigour so undeserved, force
me to believe that I had needed but to deceive you in
order to obtain greater indulgence?</p>

<p>I do not repent of a conduct which I owed you, as I
owed it to myself; but by what fatality does each praiseworthy
action of mine become the signal for a fresh misfortune?</p>

<p>It was after giving occasion for the only praise you
have ever yet deigned to accord my conduct that I
had to groan, for the first time, over the misfortune of
having displeased you. It was after proving my perfect
submission by depriving myself of the happiness of
seeing you, simply to reassure your delicacy, that you
wished to break off all correspondence with me, to rob
me of that feeble compensation for a sacrifice which you
had required, and to take from me even the very love
which alone had given you the right to ask it. It is, in
short, after having spoken to you with a sincerity which
even the interest of that love could not abate that you
shun me to-day, like some dangerous seducer whose perfidy
you have found out.</p>

<p>Will you, then, never grow weary of being unjust? At
least, tell me what new wrongs can have urged you to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
such severity, and do not refuse to dictate to me the orders
which you wish me to obey; when I pledge myself to
fulfil them, is it too great a pretension to ask that I may
know them?</p>

<br><small>THE PRÉSIDENTE DE TOURVEL TO THE VICOMTE DE VALMONT</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">You</span> seem surprised at my behaviour, Monsieur, and
within an ace of asking me to account to you for it, as
though you had the right to blame it. I confess that I
should have thought it was rather I who was authorized
to be astonished and to complain; but, since the refusal
contained in your last letter, I have adopted the course
of wrapping myself in an indifference which affords no
ground for remarks or reproaches. However, as you ask
me for enlightenment, and I, thanks be to Heaven, am
conscious of naught within me which should prevent my
granting your request, I am quite willing to enter once
more into an explanation with you.</p>

<p>Anyone reading your letters would believe me to be
fantastic or unjust. I think it is not in my deserts that
anyone should have this opinion of me; it seems to me,
above all, that you, less than any other, have cause to form
it. Doubtless, you felt that, in requiring my justification, you
forced me to recall all that has passed between us.
Apparently, you thought you had only to gain by this
examination: as I, on my side, believe I have nothing to
lose by it, at least in your eyes, I do not fear to undertake
it. Perhaps, it is indeed the only means of discovering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
which of us has the right to complain of the other.</p>

<p>To start, Monsieur, from the day of your arrival in this
<i>château</i>, you will admit, I suppose, that your reputation,
at least, authorized me to employ a certain reserve with
you; and that I might have confined myself to the bare
expression of the coldest politeness, without fearing to be
taxed with excessive prudery. You yourself would have
treated me with indulgence, and would have thought
it natural that a woman so little formed should not
have the necessary merits to appreciate yours. That,
surely, had been the part of prudence; and it would have
cost me the less to follow in that, I will not conceal
from you, when Madame de Rosemonde informed me of
your arrival, I had need to remind myself of my friendship
for her, and of her own for you, not to betray
how greatly this news annoyed me.</p>

<p>I admit willingly that you showed yourself at first under
a more favourable aspect than I had imagined; but you
will agree, in your turn, that it lasted but a little while, and
you were soon tired of a constraint for which, apparently,
you did not find yourself sufficiently compensated by the
advantageous notion it had given me of you. It was then
that, abusing my good faith, my feeling of security, you
were not afraid to pester me with a sentiment by which
you could not doubt but that I should be offended; and
I, whilst you were occupied in aggravating your errors by
repeating them, sought a reason for forgetting them, by
offering you the opportunity of, at least in part, retrieving
them. My request was so just that you yourself thought
you ought not to refuse it; but making a right out of my
indulgence, you profited by it to ask for a permission
which, without a doubt, I ought not to have granted you,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
and which, however, you obtained. Conditions were attached
to it: you have kept no one of them; and your correspondence
has been of such a kind that each one of your
letters made it my duty not to reply to you. It was at
the very moment when your obstinacy was forcing me to
send you away from me that, by a perhaps culpable condescension,
I attempted the only means which could permit
me to be concerned with you: but what value has virtuous
sentiment in your eyes? Friendship you despise;
and, in your mad intoxication, counting shame and misery
for naught, you seek only for pleasures and for victims.</p>

<p>As frivolous in your proceedings as inconsequent in your
reproaches, you forget your promises, or rather you make
a jest of violating them; and, after consenting to go away
from me, you return here without being recalled; without
thought for my prayers or my arguments; without even
having the consideration to inform me, you were not afraid
to expose me to a surprise whose effect, although assuredly
very simple, might have been interpreted to my detriment
by the persons who surrounded us. Far from seeking to
distract from or to dissipate the moment of embarrassment
you had occasioned, you seem to have given all your pains
to increase it. At table you choose your seat precisely at
the side of my own; a slight indisposition forces me to leave
before the others, and, instead of respecting my solitude,
you contrive that all the company should come to trouble it.
On my return to the drawing-room, I cannot make a step
but I find you at my side; if I say a word, it is always
you who reply to me. The most indifferent remark serves
you for a pretext to bring up a conversation which I refuse
to hear, which might even compromise me; for, in short,
Monsieur, whatever the address you may bring to bear, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
think that what I understand may also be understood by
the others.</p>

<p>Forced thus to take refuge in immobility and silence,
you none the less continue to persecute me; I cannot
raise my eyes without encountering yours. I am incessantly
compelled to avert my gaze; and by an incomprehensible
inconsequence you draw upon me the eyes of the company
at a moment when I would have even wished it possible
to escape from my own.</p>

<p>And you complain of my behaviour! and you are surprised
at my eagerness to avoid you! Ah, blame rather
my indulgence; be surprised that I did not leave at the
moment of your arrival. I ought, perhaps, to have done
so, and you will compel me to this violent, but necessary,
course, if you do not finally cease your offensive pursuit.
No, I do not forget, I never shall forget what I owe to
myself, what I owe to the ties I have formed, which I
respect and cherish; and I pray you to believe that, if
ever I found myself reduced to the unhappy choice of
sacrificing them, or of sacrificing myself, I should not
hesitate an instant. Adieu, Monsieur.</p>

<br><small>THE VICOMTE DE VALMONT TO THE MARQUISE DE MERTEUIL</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="noin">I <span class="smcap">intended</span> to go hunting this morning: but the weather
was detestable. All that I have to read is a new romance
which would bore even a school-girl. It will be two hours,
at the earliest, before we breakfast: so that, in spite of my
long letter of yesterday, I will have another talk with you.
I am very certain not to weary you, for I shall tell you of
<i>the handsome Prévan</i>. How was it you never heard of his
famous adventure, the one which separated the <i>inseparables</i>?
I wager that you will recall it at the first word. Here it
is, however, since you desire it.</p>

<p>You will remember that all Paris marvelled that three
women, all three pretty, all three with like qualities
and able to make the same pretensions, should remain
intimately allied amongst themselves, ever since the
moment of their entry into the world. At first, one
seemed to find the reason in their extreme shyness:
but soon, surrounded, as they were, by a numerous
court whose homages they shared, and enlightened as to
their value by the eagerness and zeal of which they were
the objects, their union only became the firmer; and one
would have said that the triumph of one was always that
of the two others. One hoped at least that the moment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
of love would lead to a certain rivalry. Our rakes disputed
the honour of being the apple of discord; and I
myself should have entered their ranks, had the great
consideration in which the Comtesse de *** was held at the
time permitted me to be unfaithful to her before I had
obtained the favours I demanded.</p>

<p>However, our three beauties, during the same carnival,
made their choice as though in concert; and, far from this
exciting the storms which had been predicted, it only
rendered their friendship more interesting, by the charm
of the confidences entailed.</p>

<p>The crowd of unhappy suitors was added, then, to that
of jealous women, and such scandalous constancy was held
up to public censure. Some pretended that, in this society
of <i>inseparables</i> (so it was dubbed at that time), the fundamental
law was the community of goods, and that love
itself was included therein; others asserted that, if the
three lovers were exempt from rivals of their own sex, they
were not from those of the other: people went so far as
to say that they had but been admitted for decency’s sake,
and had obtained only a title without an office.</p>

<p>These rumours, true or false, had not the effect which one
would have predicted. The three couples, on the contrary,
felt that they were lost if they separated at such a
moment; they decided to set their heads against the storm.
The public, which tires of everything, soon tired of an
ineffectual satire. Borne on the wings of its natural
levity, it busied itself with other objects: then, casting back
to that one with its habitual inconsequence, its criticism
was converted into praise. As all things go by fashion
here, the enthusiasm gained; it was become a real delirium,
when Prévan undertook to verify these prodigies,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
and settle the public opinion about them, as well as
his own.</p>

<p>He sought out therefore these models of perfection.
He was easily admitted into their society, and drew a
favourable omen from this. He was well aware that
happy persons are not so easy of access. He soon saw,
in fact, that this so vaunted happiness was, like that of
kings, rather to be envied than desired. He remarked
that, amongst these pretended inseparables, they were
beginning to seek for pleasures abroad, and even to occupy
themselves with distractions; and he concluded therefrom,
that the bonds of love or friendship were already loosened
or broken, and that those of self-conceit and custom alone
retained some strength. The women, however, whose
need brought them together, kept up amongst themselves
an appearance of the same intimacy: but the men, who
were freer in their proceedings, discovered duties to fulfil,
or affairs to carry on; they still complained of these, but no
longer neglected them, and the evenings were rarely complete.</p>

<p>This conduct on their part was profitable to the assiduous
Prévan, who, being naturally placed beside the
deserted one of the day, found a means of offering
alternately, and according to circumstances, the same
homage to each of the three friends. He could easily
perceive that to make a choice between them was
to lose everything; that false shame at proving the first
to be unfaithful would make the preferred one afraid;
that the wounded vanity of the two others would render
them the enemies of the new lover, and that they would
not fail to oppose him with the severity of their high
principles; in short, that jealousy would surely revive the
zeal of a rival who might be still to fear. Everything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
would be an obstacle; in his triple project all became
easy: each woman was indulgent because she was interested
in it; each man, because he thought that he was not.</p>

<p>Prévan, who had, at that time, but one woman to
sacrifice, was lucky enough to see her become a celebrity.
Her quality of foreigner, and the homage of a great
Prince, adroitly refused, had fixed on her the eyes of the
Court and the Town; her lover participated in the honour,
and profited from it with his new mistresses. The only
difficulty was to conduct his three intrigues at an equal
pace; their progress had, of course, to be regulated by that
of the one which lagged the most; in fact, I heard from
one of his confidants, that his greatest difficulty was to
hold in hand one which was ripe for gathering nearly a
fortnight before the rest.</p>

<p>At last the great day arrived. Prévan, who had obtained
the three avowals, was already master of the situation,
and arranged it as you will see. Of the three
husbands, one was absent, the other was leaving the next
day at day-break, the third was in town. The inseparable
friends were to sup at the future widow’s; but
the new master had permitted the former gallants to be
invited there. On the morning of that very day, he
divided the letters of his fair into three lots; he enclosed
in one the portrait which he had received from her, in
the second an amorous device which she had painted
herself, in the third a tress of her hair; each of the friends
received this third of a sacrifice as the whole, and consented,
in return, to send to her disgraced lover a signal
letter of rupture.</p>

<p>This was much; but it was not enough. She whose
husband was in Town could only dispose of the day;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
it was arranged that a pretended indisposition should
dispense her from going to supper with her friend,
and that the evening should be given entirely to Prévan;
the night was granted by her whose husband was absent;
and day-break, the moment of the departure of the third
spouse, was appointed by the last for the shepherd’s hour.</p>

<p>Prévan, who neglected nothing, next hastened to the fair
foreigner, brought there and aroused the humour which
he required, and only left after having brought about a
quarrel which assured him four-and-twenty hours of liberty.
His dispositions thus made, he returned home, intending to
take some hours’ repose. Other business was awaiting him.</p>

<p>The letters of rupture had brought a flash of light
to the disgraced lovers: none of them had any doubt but
that he had been sacrificed to Prévan; and spite at being
tricked uniting with the ill-humour which is almost always
engendered by the petty humiliation of being deserted, all
three, without communicating with one another, but as
though in concert, resolved to have satisfaction, and took
the course of demanding it from their fortunate rival.</p>

<p>The latter found the three challenges awaiting him; he
accepted them loyally, but not wishing to sacrifice either his
pleasures or the glamour of this adventure, he fixed the
<i>rendez-vous</i> for the following morning, and gave all three
assignations at the same place and the same hour. It was
at one of the gates of the Bois de Boulogne.</p>

<p>When evening came, he ran his triple course with equal
success; at least, he boasted subsequently that each one of
his new mistresses had received three times the wage and
declaration of his love. In this, as you may imagine, proofs
are lacking to history; all that the impartial historian can do is
to point out to the incredulous reader that vanity and exalted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
imagination can beget prodigies; nay more, that the morning
which was to follow so brilliant a night seemed to promise
a dispensation from all concern for the future. Be that as
it may, the facts which follow are more authentic.</p>

<p>Prévan repaired punctually to the <i>rendez-vous</i> which he
had selected; he found there his three rivals, somewhat
surprised at meeting, and each of them, perhaps, a trifle
consoled at the sight of his companions in misfortune.
He accosted them with a blunt but affable air, and used this
language to them—it has been faithfully reported to me:</p>

<p>“Gentlemen,” said he, “as I find you all here together,
you have doubtless divined that you have all three the
same cause of complaint against me. I am ready to give
you satisfaction. Let chance decide between you which of
the three shall first attempt a vengeance to which you have
all an equal right. I have brought with me neither second
nor witnesses. I did not include any in my offence;
I seek none in my reparation.” Then, agreeable to his
character as a gamester, he added, “I know one rarely
holds in three hands running; but, whatever fortune
may befall me, one has always lived long enough when
one has had time to win the love of women and the
esteem of men.”</p>

<p>Whilst his astonished adversaries looked at one another
in silence, and their delicacy, perhaps, reflected that this
triple contest rendered the game hardly fair, Prévan resumed:</p>

<p>“I do not hide from you that the night which I have just
passed has cruelly fatigued me. It would be generous of
you to permit me to recruit my strength. I have given
orders for a breakfast to be served on the ground; do me
the honour to partake of it. Let us breakfast together,
and, above all, let us breakfast gaily. One can fight for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
such trifles; but they ought not, I think, to spoil our good
humour.”</p>

<p>The breakfast was accepted. Never, it is said, was
Prévan more amiable. He was skilled enough to avoid
humiliating any one of his rivals, to persuade them that
they would have easily had a like success, and, above all,
to make them admit that, no more than he, would they
have let the occasion slip. These facts once admitted,
everything arranged itself. The breakfast was not finished
before they had repeated a dozen times that such women
did not deserve that men of honour should fight for them.
This idea promoted cordiality; it was so well fortified by
wine that, a few moments later, it was not enough merely
to bear no more ill-will: they swore an unreserved
friendship.</p>

<p>Prévan, who doubtless liked this <i>dénouement</i> as well as
the other, would not for that, however, lose any of his
celebrity. In consequence, adroitly adapting his plans
to circumstances: “In truth,” he said to the three victims,
“it is not on me but on your faithless mistresses that
you should take revenge. I offer you the opportunity. I
begin to feel already, like yourselves, an injury which
would soon be my share: for if none of you could succeed
in retaining a single one, how can I hope to retain
all three? Your quarrel becomes my own. Accept a
supper this evening at my <i>petite maison</i>, and I hope your
vengeance may not be long postponed.” They wished
to make him explain: but, with that tone of superiority
which the circumstances authorized him to adopt, he
answered, “Gentlemen, I think I have proved to you that
my conduct is founded on a certain wit; trust in me.” All
consented; and, after having embraced their new friend, they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
separated till the evening to await the issue of his
promises.</p>

<p>Prévan returns to Paris without wasting time, and goes,
according to the usage, to visit his new conquests. He
obtained a promise from each to come the same evening
and sup <i>tête-à-tête</i> at his pleasure-house. Two of them
raised a few objections; but what can one refuse on the
day after? He fixed the <i>rendez-vous</i> for a late hour, time
being necessary for his plans. After these preparations
he retired, sent word to the other three conspirators, and
all four went gaily to await their victims.</p>

<p>The first is heard arriving. Prévan comes forward alone,
receives her with an air of alacrity, conducts her into the
sanctuary of which she believed herself to be the divinity;
then, disappearing under some slight pretext, he allows
himself to be forthwith replaced by the outraged lover.</p>

<p>You may guess how the confusion of a woman who
had not yet the habit of adventures rendered triumph
easy: any reproach not made was counted for a grace;
and the truant slave, once more handed over to her former
master, was only too happy to be able to hope for pardon
by resuming her former chain. The treaty of peace was
ratified in a more solitary place, and the empty stage was
successively filled by the other actors in almost the same
fashion, and always with the same result. Each of the
women, however, still thought herself alone to be in question.
Their astonishment and embarrassment increased
when, at supper-time, the three couples were united; but
confusion reached its height when Prévan, reappearing in
their midst, had the cruelty to make his excuses to the
three faithless ones, which, by revealing their secret, told
them completely to what a point they had been fooled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span></p>

<p>However, they went to table, and soon afterwards countenances
cleared; the men gave themselves up, the women
submitted. All had hatred in their hearts; but the conversation
was none the less tender: gaiety aroused desire,
which, in its turn, lent to gaiety fresh charm. This
astounding orgy lasted until morning; and, when they
separated, the women had thought to be pardoned: but
the men, who had retained their resentment, made on
the following morning a rupture which was never healed;
and, not content with leaving their fickle mistresses, they
sealed their vengeance by making their adventure public.
Since that time one has gone into a convent, and the two
other languish in exile on their estates.</p>

<p>That is the story of Prévan; it is for you to say whether
you wish to add to his glory, and tie yourself to his car
of triumph. Your letter has really given me some anxiety,
and I await impatiently a more prudent and clearer reply
to the last I wrote you.</p>

<p>Adieu, my fair friend; distrust those queer or amusing
ideas which too easily seduce you. Remember that, in
the career which you are leading, wit alone does not
suffice; one single imprudence becomes an irremediable
ill. In short, allow a prudent friendship to be sometimes
the guide of your pleasures.</p>

<p>Adieu. I love you nevertheless, just as much as though
you were reasonable.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="LETTER_THE_EIGHTIETH">LETTER THE EIGHTIETH

<br><small>THE CHEVALIER DANCENY TO CÉCILE VOLANGES</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">Cécile</span>, my dear Cécile, when will the time come for us to
meet again? How shall I learn to live afar from you?
Who will give me the courage and the strength? Never,
never shall I be able to support this fatal absence. Each
day adds to my unhappiness: and there is no term to
look forward to!</p>

<p>Valmont, who had promised me help and consolation,
Valmont neglects and, perhaps, forgets me! He is near
the object of his love; he forgets what one feels when
one is parted from it. When forwarding your last letter
to me, he did not write to me. It is he, however, who
should tell me when, and by what means, I shall be able
to see you. Has he nothing then to tell me? You yourself
do not speak of it to me; could it be that you do
not participate in my desire? Ah, Cécile, Cécile, I am
very unhappy! I love you more than ever: but this love
which makes the charm of my life becomes its torture.</p>

<p>No, I can no longer live thus; I must see you, I must,
were it only for a moment. When I rise, I say to myself:
I shall not see her. I lie down saying: I have not
seen her.... The long, long days contain no moment of
happiness. All is privation, regret, despair; and all these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
ills come to me from the source whence I expected every
pleasure! Add to these mortal pains my anxiety about
yours, and you will have an idea of my situation. I think
of you uninterruptedly, and never without dismay. If I
see you afflicted, unhappy, I suffer for all your sorrows;
if I see you calm and consoled, my own are redoubled.
Everywhere I find unhappiness.</p>

<p>Ah, how different it was from this, when you dwelt in
the same places as I did! All was pleasure then. The
certainty of seeing you embellished even the moments of
absence; the time which had to be passed away from
you glided away as it brought you nearer to me. The
use I made of it was never unknown to you. If I fulfilled
my duties, they rendered me more worthy of you;
if I cultivated any talent, I hoped the more to please you.
Even when the distractions of the world carried me far away
from you, I was not parted from you. At the play-house
I sought to divine what would have pleased you; a concert
reminded me of your talents and our sweet occupations.
In company, on my walks, I seized upon the slightest
resemblance. I compared you with all; everywhere you
had the advantage. Every moment of the day was marked
by fresh homage, and every evening I brought the tribute
of it to your feet.</p>

<p>Nowadays, what remains to me? Dolorous regrets,
eternal privations, and a faint hope that Valmont’s silence
may be broken, that yours shall be changed to inquietude.
Ten leagues alone divide us, and that distance, so easy
to traverse, becomes to me alone an insurmountable
obstacle! And when I implore my friend, my mistress, to
help me to overcome it, both remain cold and unmoved!
Far from aiding me, they do not even reply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span></p>

<p>What has become then of the active friendship of Valmont?
What, above all, has become of your tender sentiments,
which made you so ingenious in discovering the means
of our daily meetings? Sometimes, I remember, without
ceasing to desire them, I found myself compelled to forego
them for considerations, duties; what did you not say to
me then? With how many pretexts did you not combat
my reasons? And let me remind you, my Cécile, my
reasons always gave way to your wishes. I do not make
a merit of it; it has not even that of sacrifice. What
you desired to obtain I was burning to bestow. But now
I ask in my turn; and what is the request? To see you
for a moment, to renew to you and to receive a vow
of eternal love. Does that no longer make your happiness
as it makes mine? I thrust aside that despairing idea,
which would set the crown upon my ills. You love me,
you will always love me, I believe it, I am sure of it,
I will never doubt it: but my situation is frightful, and I
can not endure it much longer. Adieu, Cécile.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="LETTER_THE_EIGHTY-FIRST">LETTER THE EIGHTY-FIRST

<br><small>THE MARQUISE DE MERTEUIL TO THE VICOMTE DE VALMONT</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">How</span> your fears excite my pity! How they prove to me
my superiority over you! And you want to teach me, to
be my guide? Ah, my poor Valmont, what a distance
there is between you and me! No, all the pride of your
sex would not suffice to bridge over the gulf which
separates us. Because you could not execute my projects,
you judge them impossible! Proud and weak being, it
well becomes you to seek to weigh my means and judge of
my resources! In truth, Vicomte, your counsels have put
me in an ill-humour, and I will not conceal it from you.</p>

<p>That, to mask your incredible stupidity with your
Présidente, you should blazon out to me, as a triumph,
the fact of your having for a moment put out of countenance
this woman who is timid and who loves you: I
agree to that; of having obtained a look, a single look:
I smile, and grant it you. That, feeling, in spite of yourself,
the poor value of your conduct, you should hope to
distract my attention from it by gratifying me with the
story of your sublime effort to bring together two children
who are both burning to see one another, and who, I
may mention by the way, owe to me alone the ardour
of their desire: I grant you that also. That, finally, you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
should feel authorized by these brilliant achievements to
write to me, in doctorial tones, <i>that it is better to employ
one’s time in carrying out one’s projects than in describing
them</i>: such vanity does me no harm and I forgive it.
But that you could believe that I had need of your prudence,
that I should lose my way unless I deferred to your
advice, that I ought to sacrifice a pleasure or a whim: in
truth, Vicomte, that is indeed to plume yourself over
much on the confidence which I am quite willing to
place in you!</p>

<p>And, pray, what have you done that I have not
surpassed a thousand times? You have seduced, ruined
even, very many women: but what difficulties have you
had to overcome? What obstacles to surmount? What
merit lies therein that is really your own? A handsome
face, the pure result of chance; graces, which habit
almost always brings; wit, in truth: but jargon would
supply its place at need; a praiseworthy impudence,
perhaps due solely to the ease of your first successes; if
I am not mistaken, these are your means, for, as for the
celebrity you have succeeded in acquiring, you will not
ask me, I suppose, to count for much the art of giving
birth to a scandal or seizing the opportunity of one.</p>

<p>As for prudence, <i>finesse</i>, I do not speak of myself: but
where is the woman who has not more than you? Why,
your Présidente leads you like a child!</p>

<p>Believe me, Vicomte, it is rarely one acquires qualities
which cannot be dispensed with. Fighting without risk,
you are bound to act without precaution. For you men,
a defeat is but one success the less. In so unequal a
match, we are fortunate if we do not lose, as it is your
misfortune if you do not win. Even were I to grant you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
as many talents as ourselves, by how many should we not
still need to surpass you, from the necessity we are under
to make a perpetual use of them!</p>

<p>Supposing, I admit, that you brought as much skill to
the task of conquering us as we show in defending
ourselves or in yielding, you will at least agree that it
becomes useless to you after your success. Absorbed solely
in your new fancy, you abandon yourself to it without
fear, without reserve: it is not to you that its duration is
important.</p>

<p>In fact, those bonds reciprocally given and received,
to talk love’s jargon, you alone can tighten or break at
your will: we are even lucky if, in your wantonness,
preferring mystery to noise, you are satisfied with an
humiliating desertion, without making the idol of yesterday
the victim of to-morrow.</p>

<p>But when an unfortunate woman has once felt the weight
of her chain, what risks she has to run, if she but endeavours
to shake it off! It is only with trembling that she
can attempt to dismiss from her the man whom her heart
repulses with violence. Does he insist on remaining, she
must yield to fear what she had granted to love:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<i>Ses bras s’ouvrent encor quand son cœur est ferme.</i>”</p>
</div>

<p class="noin">Her prudence must skilfully unravel those same bonds
which you would have broken. At the mercy of her
enemy, if he be without generosity, she is without resources:
and how can she hope generosity from him when,
although he is sometimes praised for having it, he is
never blamed for lacking it?</p>

<p>Doubtless, you will not deny these truths, which are so
evident as to have become trivial. If, however, you have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
seen me, disposing of opinions and events, making these
formidable men the toys of my fantasy and my caprice,
depriving some of the power, some of the will to hurt me;
if I have known, turn by turn, according to my fickle
fancy, how to attach to my service or drive far away
from me</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<i>Ces tyrans détrônés devenus mes esclaves;</i>”<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>
</div>

<p class="noin">if in the midst of these frequent revolutions my reputation
has still remained pure; ought you not to have concluded
that, being born to avenge my sex and to dominate yours,
I had devised methods previously unknown?</p>

<p>Oh! keep your advice and your fears for those delirious
women who call themselves <i>sentimental</i>; whose exalted
imagination would make one believe that nature has placed
their senses in their heads; who, having never reflected,
persist in confounding love with the lover; who, in their
mad illusion, believe that he with whom they have pursued
pleasure is its sole depository; and, truly superstitious,
show the priest the respect and faith which is only due to
the divinity. Be still more afraid for those who, their
vanity being larger than their prudence, do not know, at
need, how to consent to being abandoned. Tremble, above
all, for those women, active in their indolence, whom you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
call <i>women of sensibility</i>, and over whom love takes hold
so easily and with such power; who feel the need of being
occupied with it, even when they are not enjoying it; and,
giving themselves up unreservedly to the fermentation of
their ideas, bring forth from them those letters so sweet,
but so dangerous to write, and are not afraid to confide
these proofs of their weakness to the object which causes
it: imprudent ones, who do not know how to discern in
their present lover their enemy to be.</p>

<p>But what have I in common with these unreflecting
women? When have you ever seen me depart from the
rules I have laid down, or be false to my principles? I
say my principles, and I say so designedly; for they are
not, like those of other women, the result of chance,
received without scrutiny, and followed out of habit; they
are the fruit of my profound reflexions; I have created
them, and I may say that I am my own handiwork.</p>

<p>Entering the world at a time when, still a girl, I was
compelled by my condition to be silent and inert, I knew
how to profit by observing and reflecting. Whilst I was
thought heedless or inattentive, and, in truth, listened little
to the remarks that they were careful to make to me,
I carefully gathered up those which they sought to hide
from me.</p>

<p>This useful curiosity, while serving to instruct me, also
taught me dissimulation; often forced to conceal the objects
of my attention from the eyes of those who surrounded
me, I sought to direct my own whither I desired; I learned
then how to assume at will that remote look which you
have so often praised. Encouraged by this first success,
I tried to govern equally the different movements of my
face. Did I experience some vexation, I studied to assume<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
an air of serenity, even of joy; I have carried my zeal so
far as to inflict voluntary pain on myself, in order to seek,
at that time, an expression of pleasure. I laboured, with
the same care and greater difficulty, to repress the symptoms
of unexpected joy. It was thus that I gained that command
over my physiognomy at which I have sometimes
seen you so astonished.</p>

<p>I was very young still, and almost without interest: my
thoughts were all that I had, and I was indignant that
these should be stolen from me or surprised against my
will. Armed with these first weapons, I amused myself
by showing myself under different forms. Sure of my gestures,
I kept a watch upon my speech; I regulated both
according to circumstances, or even merely according to
my whim; from that moment the colour of my thought
was my secret, and I never revealed more of it than it
was useful for me to show.</p>

<p>This labour spent upon myself had fixed my attention on
the expression of faces and the character of physiognomy;
and I thus gained that penetrating glance to which experience,
indeed, has taught me not to trust entirely, but
which, on the whole, has rarely deceived me. I was not
fifteen years old, I possessed already the talents to which
the greater part of our politicians owe their reputation, and
I was as yet only at the rudiments of the science which
I wished to acquire. You may well imagine that, like all
young girls, I sought to find out about love and its pleasures;
but having never been to the convent, having no confidential
friend, and being watched by a vigilant mother,
I had only vague notions, which I could not fix; even
nature, which later, I had, assuredly, no reason to do aught
but praise, as yet afforded me no hint. One might have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
said that it was working in silence at the perfection of its
handiwork. My head alone was in a ferment; I did not
desire enjoyment, I wanted to know: the desire for
information suggested to me the means.</p>

<p>I felt that the only man with whom I could speak on
this matter without compromising myself was my confessor.
I took my course at once; I surmounted my slight feeling
of shame; and vaunting myself for a sin which I had not
committed, I accused myself of having done <i>all that
women do</i>. That was my expression; but, in speaking so,
I did not know, in truth, what idea I was expressing. My
hope was not altogether deceived, nor entirely fulfilled;
the fear of betraying myself prevented me from enlightening
myself: but the good father represented the ill as so great
that I concluded the pleasure to be extreme; and to
the desire of knowing it the desire of tasting it succeeded.</p>

<p>I do not know whither this desire would have led me;
and, devoid of experience as I was at that time, perhaps
a single opportunity would have ruined me: luckily for
me, my mother informed me, a few days later, that I was
to be married; the certainty of knowing extinguished my
curiosity at once, and I came a virgin to the arms of
M. de Merteuil.</p>

<p>I waited with calmness for the moment which was to
enlighten me, and I had need of reflexion, in order to
exhibit embarrassment and fear. The first night, of which
ordinarily one entertains an idea so painful or so sweet,
presented itself to me only as an occasion of experience:
pain and pleasure, I observed all carefully, and saw in
these different sensations only facts upon which to reflect
and meditate. This form of study soon succeeded in
pleasing me: but, faithful to my principles, and feeling by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
instinct perhaps that no one ought to be further from my
confidence than my husband, I resolved to appear the
more impassive in his eyes, the more sensible I really was.
This apparent coldness was subsequently the impregnable
foundation of his blind confidence; as a second reflexion,
I joined to it the mischievous air which my age justified;
and he never thought me more of a child than when I
was tricking him most.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I will admit, I, at first, let myself be dragged
into the vortex of society, and gave myself up completely
to its futile distractions. But, after some months, M. de
Merteuil having taken me to his dismal country estate, the
dread of <i>ennui</i> revived the taste for study in me: and as
I found myself there surrounded by people whose distance
from me put me out of the reach of all suspicion, I profited
by it to give a vaster field to my experience. It was there
especially that I assured myself that love, which they vaunt
to us as the cause of our pleasures, is, at the most, only
the pretext for them.</p>

<p>The illness of M. de Merteuil came to interrupt these
sweet occupations; it was necessary to follow him to Town,
where he went to seek for aid. He died, as you know,
shortly afterwards; and although, considering all things, I
had no complaint to make against him, I had, none the
less, a lively feeling of the value of the liberty which my
widowhood would give me, and I promised myself to take
advantage of it. My mother calculated on my entering
a convent, or returning to live with her. I refused to take
either course, and all I granted to decency, was to go
back to the same country estate, where there were still some
observations left for me to make.</p>

<p>I supplemented these with the help of reading: but do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
not imagine it was all of the kind you suppose. I studied
our manners in novels, our opinions in the philosophers;
I even went to the most severe moralists to see what
they expected from us; and I thus made sure of what
one could do, of what one ought to think, and of how
one must appear. My mind once settled upon these three
matters, the last alone presented any difficulties in its
execution; I hoped to overcome them, and I meditated
on the means.</p>

<p>I began to grow tired of my rustic pleasures, which
were not varied enough for my active brain; I felt the
need of coquetry, which should reunite me to love, not
in order that I might really feel it, but to feign and
inspire it. In vain had I been told, and had I read, that
one could not feign this sentiment; I saw that, to succeed
there, it sufficed to join the talent of a comedian to an
author’s wit. I exercised myself in both kinds, and,
perhaps, with some success: but, instead of seeking the
vain applause of the theatre, I resolved to employ for my
happiness that which so many others sacrificed to vanity.</p>

<p>A year passed in these different occupations. My
mourning then allowing me to reappear, I returned to
Town with my great projects; I was not prepared for the
first obstacle which I encountered.</p>

<p>My long solitude and austere retreat had covered me
with a veneer of prudery which frightened our <i>beaux</i>;
they kept their distance, and left me at the mercy of a
crowd of tedious fellows, who all were aspirants for my
hand. The embarrassment did not lie in refusing them; but
many of these refusals displeased my family, and in these
internal disputes I lost the time of which I had promised
myself to make such charming use. I was obliged, then,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
in order to recall some and drive away the others, to
display certain inconsistencies, and to take as much pains in
damaging my reputation as I had thought to take in
preserving it. I succeeded easily, as you may believe:
but, being carried away by no passion, I only did what I
thought necessary, and measured out my doses of indiscretion
with caution.</p>

<p>As soon as I had touched the goal which I would
attain, I retraced my steps, and gave the honour of my
amendment to some of those women who, being impotent
as far as any pretensions to charm are concerned, fall
back on those of merit and virtue. This was a move
which was of more value to me than I had hoped. These
grateful duennas set themselves up as my apologists; and
their blind zeal for what they called their work was carried
to such an extent that, at the least reflexion which might
be made on me, the whole party of prudes cried scandal
and outrage. The same method procured me also the
suffrages of the women with pretensions, who, being
persuaded that I had renounced the thought of following
the same career as theirs, selected me as a subject for
their praise, each time they wished to prove that they
did not speak ill of all the world.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, my previous conduct had brought back the
lovers; and to compromise between them and the unfaithful
women who had become my patronesses, I passed as a
woman of sensibility, but rigour, whom the excess of her
delicacy furnished with arms against love.</p>

<p>I then began to display upon the great stage the talents
which had been given me. My first care was to acquire
the reputation of being invincible. To attain it, the men
who did not please me were always the only ones whose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
homage I had the air of accepting. I employed them
usefully to obtain for me the honours of resistance, whilst
to the preferred lover I abandoned myself without fear.
But the latter, my pretended shyness never permitted to
follow me in the world; and the gaze of society has thus
been always fixed on the unhappy lover.</p>

<p>You know with what rapidity I choose: it is because
I have observed that it is nearly always the previous
attentions which disclose a woman’s secret. Whatever one
may say, the tone is never the same before and after
success. This difference does not escape the attentive
observer; and I have found it less dangerous to be deceived
in my choice than to let that choice be penetrated.
I gain here again by removing probabilities, by which
alone we can be judged.</p>

<p>These precautions and that of never writing, of never
giving any proof of my defeat, might appear excessive,
and to me have ever appeared insufficient. I have
looked into my own heart, I have studied in it the heart
of others. I saw there that there is nobody who does
not keep a secret there which it is of importance to him
should not be divulged: a truth which antiquity seems
to have known better than we, and of which the
history of Samson might be no more than an ingenious
symbol. Like a new Delilah, I have always employed
my power in surprising this important secret. Ah, of
how many of our modern Samsons have not the locks
fallen beneath my shears? And these, I have ceased
to fear them; they are the only ones whom I have sometimes
permitted myself to humiliate. More supple with the
others, the art of rendering them unfaithful lest I should
appear to them fickle, a feint of friendship, an appearance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
of confidence, a few generous measures, the flattering
notion, which each one retains, of having been my
only lover, have secured me their discretion. Finally,
when these methods failed me, foreseeing the rupture, I
knew how to crush in advance, beneath ridicule or calumny,
the credence which these dangerous men could
have obtained.</p>

<p>All this which I tell you you have seen me practise
unceasingly; and you doubt of my prudence! Ah,
indeed! recall to mind the time when you paid me your
first attentions: no homage was ever more flattering to
me; I desired you before I had ever seen you. Seduced
by your reputation, it seemed to me that you were
wanting to my glory; I burned with a desire for a hand-to-hand
combat with you. It is the only one of my
fancies which ever had a moment’s empire over me.
However, if you had wished to destroy me, what means
would you have found? Empty talk which leaves no trace
behind it, which your very reputation would have helped
to render suspect, and a tissue of improbable facts, the
sincere relation of which would have had the air of a
badly conceived novel. It is true, since that time, I
have handed you over all my secrets: but you know
what interests unite us, and that, if it be one of us, it
is not I who can be taxed with imprudence.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>Since I have started off to render account to you, I
will do it precisely. I hear you tell me now that I am
at any rate at the mercy of my chamber-maid; in fact,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
if she is not in the secret of my sentiments, she is of my
actions. When you spoke of it to me once before, I
answered that I was sure of her; and my proof that this
reply was sufficient then for your tranquillity is that you
have since confided to her mighty dangerous secrets of
your own. But, now that you have taken umbrage at
Prévan, and that your head is turned, I doubt whether
you will believe me any more on my word. I must
therefore edify you.</p>

<p>In the first place, the girl is my foster-sister, and this
bond, which does not seem one to us, is not without
force amongst people of her condition: in addition, I have
her secret and better still, the victim of a love madness,
she was ruined, if I had not saved her. Her parents,
bristling with honour, would be satisfied by nothing less
than her imprisonment. They applied to me. I saw at a
glance how useful their anger might be made to me. I
seconded them and solicited the order, which I obtained.
Then, suddenly turning to the side of clemency, to which I
persuaded her parents, and profiting by my influence with
the old minister, I made them all consent to make me
the depositary of this order, free to stay it or demand its
execution, according to the judgment I should form of the
girl’s future conduct. She knows, then, that I have her
lot within my hands; and if, to assume the impossible,
these potent reasons should not prevent her, is it not
evident that the revelation of her conduct and her
authentic punishment would soon deprive her language of
all credit?</p>

<p>To these precautions, which I call fundamental, are
joined a thousand others, local or occasional, which habit
and reflexion allow me to find at need; of which the details<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
would be tedious, although their practice is important; and
which you must take the trouble to pick out from the
general view of my conduct, if you would succeed in
knowing them.</p>

<p>But to pretend that I have been at so much pains, and
am not to cull the fruit of them; that, after having raised
myself, by my arduous labours, so high above other women,
I am to consent to grope along, like them, betwixt imprudence
and timidity; that, above all, I should fear any
man to such an extent as to see no other salvation than
in flight? No, Vicomte, never! I must conquer or perish.
As for Prévan, I wish to have him, and I shall have him;
he wishes to tell of it, and he shall not tell of it: that, in
two words, is our little romance. Adieu.</p>

<br><small>CÉCILE VOLANGES TO THE CHEVALIER DANCENY</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">Ah</span>, God, what pain your letter gave me! I need well
have felt such impatience to receive it! I hoped to find
in it consolation, and here am I more afflicted than I was
ere I received it. I shed many tears when I read it: it
is not that with which I reproach you; I have already
wept many times because of you, without its being painful
to me. But this time, it is not the same thing.</p>

<p>What is it that you wish to say, pray? that your love
is grown a torment to you, that you cannot longer live
thus, nor any more support your situation? Do you mean
that you are going to cease to love me, because it is not so
agreeable as it used to be? It seems to me that I am
no happier than you are, quite the contrary; and yet I
only love you the more for that. If M. de Valmont has
not written to you, it is not my fault; I could not beg
him to, because I have not been alone with him, and we
have agreed that we would never speak before people: and
that again is for your sake, so that he can the better do
what you desire. I do not say that I do not desire it
also, and you ought to be assured of this: but what
would you have me do? If you believe it to be so
easy, please find the means, I ask nothing better.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span></p>

<p>Do you think it is so very agreeable for me to be scolded
every day by Mamma, who once never said anything
to me? Quite the contrary. Now it is worse than if I
were at the convent. I consoled myself for it, however,
by reflecting that it was for you; there were even moments
when I found I was quite content; but when I see that
you are vexed too, without its being in the least my fault,
I have more grief than I had for all that has hitherto
happened to me.</p>

<p>Even merely to receive your letters is embarrassing, so
that, if M. de Valmont were not so obliging and so clever
as he is, I should not know what to do; and, as to
writing to you, that is more difficult still. All the morning
I dare not, because Mamma is close by me, and she
may come, at any moment, into my room. Sometimes,
I am able to, in the afternoon, under pretence of
singing or playing on the harp; even then I have to interrupt
myself after every line, to let them hear I am studying.
Luckily my waiting-maid sometimes grows sleepy in the
evening, and I tell her that I can quite well get to bed
by myself, so that she may go away and leave me the
light. And then, I am obliged to get behind my curtain,
so that no light can be seen; and then, to listen for the
least sound, so that I can hide everything in my bed, if
anyone comes. I wish you were there to see! You
would soon see that one must indeed love anyone to do it.
In short, it is quite true that I do all that I can, and
I would it lay within my power to do more.</p>

<p>Certainly, I do not refuse to tell you that I love you,
and that I shall always love you; I never told it you with a
fuller heart; and you are vexed! Yet you had assured
me, before I said it, that that was enough to make you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
happy. You cannot deny it; it is in your letters. Although
I have them no longer, I remember them as well as when
I used to read them every day. And you, because you
are absent now, no longer think the same! But perhaps
this absence will not always last? Ah, God, how unhappy
I am! And it is indeed you who are the cause of it!...</p>

<p>With regard to your letters, I hope that you have kept
those which Mamma took from me, and which she sent
back to you; a time must come, some day, when I shall
not be so restrained as at present, and you will give
them all back to me. How happy I shall be when I am
able to see them! Now I return them to M. de Valmont,
because there would be too much danger otherwise; in
spite of that, I never give them to him without feeling a
deal of pain.</p>

<p>Adieu, my dear friend. I love you with all my heart.
I shall love you all my life. I hope that now you are no
longer vexed, and, were I sure of it, I should not be so
myself. Write to me, as soon as you are able, for I feel
that till then I shall continue sad.</p>

<br><small>THE VICOMTE DE VALMONT TO THE PRÉSIDENTE DE TOURVEL</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">For</span> mercy’s sake, Madame, let us repeat that interview
which was so unhappily broken! Oh, that I could
complete my work of proving to you how much I differ
from the odious portrait which has been made of me;
that, above all, I could again enjoy that amiable confidence
which you began to grant me! How many are the
charms with which you know how to endow virtue!
How you beautify, and render dear, every virtuous
sentiment! Ah, therein lies your fascination; it is the
strongest; it is the only one which is at once powerful
and worthy of respect.</p>

<p>Doubtless, it is enough to see you to desire to please
you; to hear you in company for that desire to be
redoubled. But he who has the happiness of knowing
you better, who can sometimes read in your soul, soon
yields to a more noble enthusiasm, and, penetrated by
veneration as by love, worships in you the image of all
the virtues. Better made than another, perhaps, to love and
follow them, although seduced by certain errors which had
separated me from them, it is you who have brought me back,
who have caused me to feel anew all their charm: will
you make a crime of this new love of mine? Will you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
blame your handiwork? Would you reproach yourself
even with the interest which you might take in it? What
harm is to be feared from so pure a sentiment, and what
sweetness might there not be to taste in it?</p>

<p>My love alarms you, you find it violent, unrestrained!
Temper it with a gentler love; do not disdain the empire
which I offer you, from which I swear never to escape,
and which, I dare believe, would not be entirely lost to
virtue. What sacrifice could seem hard to me, once sure
that your heart could keep its price for me? Where is
the man, then, who is so unhappy as not to know how
to delight in the privations which he imposes on himself,
as not to prefer a word, a glance, accorded, to all the
pleasures which he could steal or surprise? And you
believed that I was such a man, and you feared
me! Ah, why does not your happiness depend on
my own! What vengeance I would take on you, by
rendering you happy! But this gentle empire is no
result of a barren friendship; it is only due to love.</p>

<p>That word frightens you! And why? A more tender
attachment, a stronger union, a common thought, a like
happiness and a like pain, what is there in that alien to
your soul? Yet love is all that! Such, at least, is the love
which you inspire and I experience. It is that, above all,
which, calculating without interest, knows how to appreciate
actions according to their merit and not their price; it is
the inexhaustible treasure of sensitive souls, and all things
become precious that are done for or by it.</p>

<p>What, then, have these truths, so easy to grasp, so sweet
to practise, that can alarm? What fear, either, can a man
of sensibility cause you, to whom love permits no other
happiness than your own? This is the solitary vow I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
make to-day: I will sacrifice all to fulfil it, except the
sentiment by which it is inspired; and this sentiment itself,
if you do but consent to share it, you shall order as you
will. But let us suffer it no longer to divide us, when it
should unite us. If the friendship you have offered me is
not an idle word; if, as you told me yesterday, it is the
sweetest sentiment known to your soul, let that be the
bond between us; I will not reject it: but, being arbiter
of love, let it consent to listen to it; a refusal to hear it
would become an injustice, and friendship is not unjust.</p>

<p>A second interview will present no greater difficulty than
the first: chance can again furnish the occasion; you
could yourself indicate the right moment. I am willing to
believe that I am wrong; would you not be better pleased
to convince me than to combat me, and do you doubt
my docility? If that inopportune third party had not
come to interrupt us, perhaps I had already been brought
round entirely to your opinion: who knows the full extent
of your power?</p>

<p>Shall I say it to you? This invincible power, to which
I abandon myself without venturing on calculation, this
irresistible charm, which renders you sovereign of my
thoughts as of my actions: it comes to me sometimes to
fear them. Alas, perhaps it is I who should be afraid of
this interview for which I ask! After it, perhaps, bound
by my promises, I shall see myself compelled to consume
away with a love which, I am well aware, can never be
extinguished, without daring to implore your aid! Ah,
Madame, for mercy’s sake, do not abuse your authority!
But what then! if you are to be the happier for it, if I
am thereby to appear worthier of you, what pains are not
alleviated by these consoling ideas! Yes, I feel it; to speak<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
again with you is to give you stronger arms against me;
it is to submit myself more entirely to your will. It is
easier to defend myself against your letters; they are
indeed your very utterances, but you are not there to lend
them fresh strength. However, the pleasure of hearing you
leads me to brave the danger: at least I shall have the
pleasure of having dared everything for you, even against
myself; and my sacrifices will become an homage. I am
too happy to prove to you in a thousand manners, as I
feel in a thousand fashions, that you are and ever will be,
without excepting myself, the object dearest to my heart.</p>

<br><small>THE VICOMTE DE VALMONT TO CÉCILE VOLANGES</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">You</span> saw how greatly the chance was against us yesterday.
All day long I was unable to hand you the letter which
I had for you; I know not whether I shall find it any
easier to-day. I am afraid of compromising you, by
showing more zeal than discretion; and I should never
forgive myself for an imprudence which might prove so
fatal to you, and cause the despair of my friend, by
rendering you eternally miserable. However, I am aware
of the impatience of love; I feel how painful it must be
to you, in your situation, to meet with any delay in the
only consolation you can know at this moment. By dint
of busying myself with the means of removing the obstacles,
I have found one the execution of which, if you take
some pains, will be easy.</p>

<p>I think I have remarked that the key of the door of
your chamber, which opens into the corridor, is always
on your Mamma’s mantel-shelf. Everything would be
easy with this key, you must be well aware; but in default
of it, I will procure you one like it, which will serve in
its stead. To succeed in this, it will be sufficient to
have the other at my disposition for an hour or two.
You will easily find an opportunity for taking it; and, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
order that its absence may not be noticed, I enclose, in
this, one of my own which is so far like it that no
difference will be seen, unless they try it; this they are
not likely to do. You must only take care to tie it to a
faded blue ribbon, like that which is on your own.</p>

<p>It would be well to try and have this key by to-morrow
or the day after, at breakfast-time; because it will be easier
for you to give it me then, and it can be returned to its
place in the evening, a time when your Mamma might
pay more attention to it. I shall be able to return it to
you at dinner-time, if we arrange well.</p>

<p>You know that, when we move from the <i>salon</i> to the
dining-room, it is always Madame de Rosemonde who
walks last. I shall give her my hand. You will only have
to take some time in putting away your tapestry, or even
to let something drop, so that you may remain behind:
you will see then how to take the key from me, which I
shall be careful to hold behind me. You must not neglect,
as soon as you have taken it, to rejoin my old aunt and
pay her a few attentions. If by chance you should let
the key fall, do not lose your countenance; I will feign
that it was done by me, and I answer for everything.</p>

<p>The lack of confidence your Mamma shows in you, and
her harsh behaviour towards you, authorize this little
deception. It is, moreover, the only way to continue to
receive the letters of Danceny, and to forward him yours;
all others are really too dangerous and might ruin you
both irretrievably: thus my prudent friendship would reproach
itself, were I to employ them further.</p>

<p>Once having the key, there remain some precautions
for us to take against the noise of door and lock; but
they are very easy. You will find, beneath the same press<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
where I placed your paper, oil and a feather. You
sometimes go to your room at times when you are
alone there: you must profit by it to oil the lock and
hinges. The only attention you need pay is to be careful
of stains which might betray you. You had better wait
also until night arrives, because, if it be done with the intelligence
of which you are capable, there will be no trace
of it on the following morning. If, however, it should be
perceived, then you must say that it is the indoor polisher.
You must in this case specify the time, and even the conversation
which you had with him: as, for instance, that
he takes this precaution against rust with all the locks
which are not in use. For you see that it would be unlikely
that you should have witnessed this proceeding
without asking the reason. It is these little details which
give probability; and probability renders a lie without
consequence, by diminishing people’s desire to verify it.</p>

<p>After you have read this letter, I beg you to read it
again and even to study it: to begin with, one should
be well acquainted with what one wishes to do well;
next, to assure yourself that I have omitted nothing. Little
accustomed to employ <i>finesse</i> on my own account, I have
no great use for it; indeed it needed nothing less than
my keen friendship for Danceny, and the interest which
you inspire in me, to induce me to employ these means,
however innocent they may be. I hate anything which
has the air of deception; that is my character. But your
misfortunes have touched me to such a degree that I will
attempt everything to alleviate them.</p>

<p>You can imagine that, with this means of communication
once established between us, it will be far easier for me to
procure for you the interview with Danceny which he desires.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
However, do not yet speak to him of all this: you would
only increase his impatience, and the moment for satisfying
it is not yet quite arrived. You owe it to him, I think,
to calm rather than to excite him. I depend in this matter
on your delicacy. Adieu, my fair pupil, for you are my
pupil. Love your tutor a little, and above all be docile
to him: you will be rewarded. I am occupied with your
happiness; rest assured that I shall find therein my own.</p>

<br><small>THE MARQUISE DE MERTEUIL TO THE VICOMTE DE VALMONT</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">At</span> last you may be tranquil, and, above all, you can render
me justice. Listen, and do not confound me again with
other women. I have brought my adventure with Prévan
to a close. <i>To a close!</i> Do you fully understand what that
implies? Now you shall judge whether it is I, or he, who
can vaunt himself. The story will not be as amusing as the
adventure: neither would it be just that you, who have
done no more than reason ill or well about the affair,
should reap as much pleasure from it as I, who have
given my time and labour.</p>

<p>In the meantime, if you have some great scheme to
try, if you would attempt some enterprise in which this
dangerous rival should seem to you to be feared, this is
your time. He leaves the field free to you, at least for
some time; perhaps, even, he will never recover from the
blow I have given him.</p>

<p>How fortunate you are to have me for a friend! I am
a benevolent fairy to you. You languish afar from the
beauty who engrosses you; I say one word, and you find
yourself once more at her side. You wish to revenge
yourself on a woman who injures you; I point out to you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
the place where you have to strike, and abandon her to
your tender mercies. Finally, to drive a formidable competitor
from the lists, it is once more I whom you invoke, and
I give heed to you. Truly, if you do not spend your life
in thanking me, it means that you are an ingrate. I
return to my adventure and take it up from the beginning.</p>

<p>The <i>rendez-vous</i> made so loudly, on leaving the Opera,
was understood as I had hoped. Prévan repaired to it; and
when the Maréchale said to him politely that she congratulated
herself on seeing him twice in succession at her days,
he was careful to reply that, since Tuesday night, he had
cancelled a thousand engagements, in order that he might
thus dispose of that evening. <i>À bon entendeur, salut!</i> As
I wished, however, to know with more certainty whether
I was, or was not, the veritable object of this flattering
zeal, I resolved to compel the new aspirant to choose between
me and his dominant passion. I declared that I should
not play; and he, on his side, found a thousand pretexts
for not playing, and my first triumph was over lansquenet.</p>

<p>I secured the Bishop of *** for my gossip; I chose
him because of his intimacy with the hero of the day,
to whom I wished to give every facility to approach me.
I was contented also to have a respectable witness, who
could, at need, depose to my behaviour and my language.
This arrangement was successful.</p>

<p>After the vague and customary remarks, Prévan, having
soon made himself the leader of the conversation, tried
different tones in turn, in order to discover which was
likely to please me. I refused that of sentiment, as
though I had no faith in it; I stopped, by my seriousness,
his gaiety, which seemed to me too frivolous for a
<i>début</i>; he fell back upon delicate friendship; and it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
beneath this well-worn flag that we began our reciprocal
attack.</p>

<p>At supper-time, the Bishop did not descend; Prévan
then gave me his hand, and was naturally placed by my
side at table. One must be just; he maintained with
much skill our private conversation, while seeming only
to be occupied with the general conversation, to which
he had the air of being the largest contributor. At dessert,
they spoke of a new piece which was to be given
on the following Monday at the <i>Français</i>. I expressed
some regret that I had not my box; he offered me his
own, which at first, as is the usage, I refused: to which
he answered humorously enough, that I did not understand
him; that certainly, he would not make the sacrifice
of his box to anyone whom he did not know; but that
he only let me know it was at Madame la Maréchale’s
disposal. She lent herself to this pleasantry, and I
accepted.</p>

<p>On our return to the <i>salon</i>, he asked, as you may well
believe, for a place in this box; and when the Maréchale,
who treats him with great kindness, promised him it, <i>if
he were good</i>, he made it the occasion of one of those
double-edged conversations, at which you have extolled his
talent to me. Indeed, having fallen on his knees, like
a submissive child, he said, under pretext of begging for
her counsel and tasking her opinion, he uttered many
a flattering and tender thing, the application of which I
could easily take to myself. Several persons having not
returned to play after supper, the conversation was more
general and less interesting: but our eyes spoke much.
I say our eyes: I should have said his; for mine spoke
but one language—that of surprise. He must have thought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
I was astonished, and quite absorbed in the prodigious
effect which he had on me. I think I left him highly
satisfied; I was no less pleased myself.</p>

<p>On the following Monday I was at the <i>Français</i>, as we had
agreed. In spite of your literary curiosity, I can tell you
nothing of the performance, except that Prévan has a marvellous
talent for cajolery, and that the piece failed: that is all
that I learned. I was sorry to see the evening come to
an end; it had really pleased me mightily; and, in order
to prolong it, I invited the Maréchale to come and sup
with me: this gave me a pretext for proposing it to the
amiable flatterer, who only asked the time to hasten to
the Comtesses de P***,<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> and free himself from an
engagement. This name brought back all my anger; I
saw plainly that he was going to begin his confidences;
I remembered your wise counsels, and promised myself ... to
proceed with the adventure; I was certain that I should
cure him of this dangerous indiscretion.</p>

<p>Being new to my company, which was not very numerous
that evening, he owed me the customary usages; thus, when
we went to supper, he offered me his hand. I was malicious
enough, when accepting it, to allow mine to tremble slightly,
and to walk with my eyes cast down, and a quick respiration.
I had the air of having a presentiment of my defeat, and
of being afraid of my victor. He noticed it readily; then
the traitor promptly changed his tone and aspect. He had
been gallant, he became tender. It was not that his
language did not remain much the same: circumstances
compelled that; but his gaze had become less keen and
more caressing; the inflexion of his voice softer; his smile<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
was no longer the smile of <i>finesse</i>, but of satisfaction.
Finally, in his conversation, suppressing more and more
the fire of his sallies, wit gave place to delicacy. I ask
you, could you have done better yourself?</p>

<p>On my side, I grew pensive to such a point that the
company was forced to perceive it; and when I was reproached
for it, I was clever enough to defend myself
indifferently, and to cast on Prévan a rapid, yet shy and
embarrassed glance, that was to make him believe that all
my fear was lest he should divine the cause of my trouble.</p>

<p>After supper, I profited by the moment when the good
Maréchale was telling one of those stories which she is
always telling, to settle myself on my ottoman, in that
languorous condition which is induced by a tender <i>rêverie</i>.
I was not sorry for Prévan to see me thus; in truth, he
honoured me with most particular attention. You may well
imagine that my timid glances did not dare to seek the
eyes of my conqueror: but directed towards him in a more
humble fashion, they soon informed me that I was obtaining
the effect which I sought to produce. I still needed
to persuade him that I shared it; so that, when the Maréchale
announced she was going to retire, I cried out
in a faint and tender voice, “<i>Ah Dieu!</i> I was so comfortable
here!” I rose, however: but, before taking leave
of her, I asked her her plans, in order to have a
pretext for telling her mine, and of letting her know that
I should stay at home the whole of the following day.
Upon this, we all separated.</p>

<p>I then started reflecting. I had no doubt but that
Prévan would profit by the sort of <i>rendez-vous</i> I had given
him; that he would come early enough to find me alone,
and that the attack would be a fierce one: but I was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
quite sure also that, owing to my reputation, he would
not treat me with that lightness which is only employed
with women of occasion or with those who have no
experience; and I foresaw a certain success, if he pronounced
the word love, above all, if he had the pretension of
obtaining it from me.</p>

<p>How convenient it is to have dealings with you <i>people
of principles</i>! Sometimes a clumsy lover disconcerts us
by his bashfulness or embarrasses us with his fiery
transports; it is a fever which, like the other, has its
chills and ardours, and sometimes varies in its symptoms.
But the even tenor of your way is so easily divined!</p>

<p>The arrival, the aspect, the tone, the language: I knew
it all the day before.</p>

<p>I will not report our conversation to you, then; you
will easily supply it for yourself. Only remark that, in
my feigned defence, I aided him with all my power:
embarrassment, to give him time to speak; sorry reasons,
that he might combat them; distrust and fear, to revive
his protestations; and that perpetual refrain on his side
of <i>I ask you only for a word</i>; and the silence on mine,
which seemed but to delay him in order to make him
desire the more: during all that, a hand seized a hundred
times, a hand always withdrawn yet never refused. One
might pass a whole day thus; we passed a mortal hour:
we should be there, perhaps, still, if we had not heard a
carriage entering my court-yard. This fortunate occurrence
naturally rendered his entreaties livelier; and I, seeing
the moment arrive when I was out of danger of any
surprise, prepared myself by a long sigh, and granted him
the precious word. The visitor was announced, and soon
afterwards, I was surrounded by a numerous circle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span></p>

<p>Prévan begged to be allowed to come on the following
morning, and I consented: but, careful to defend myself,
I ordered my waiting-maid to remain all through the time
of this visit in my bed-chamber, whence, you know, one
can see all that passes in my dressing-room, and it was
there that I received him. Free in our conversation and
having both the same desire, we were soon in agreement:
but it was necessary to get rid of this inopportune spectator;
it was for that I was waiting.</p>

<p>Then, painting an imaginative picture of my home life, I
persuaded him without difficulty that we should never
find a moment’s liberty, and that he must consider as a
sort of miracle that which we had enjoyed yesterday, and even
that contained too great a risk for me to expose myself
to, since at any moment someone might enter my
<i>salon</i>. I did not fail to add that all these usages
were established, because, until that day, they had never
interfered with me; and I insisted at the same time upon
the impossibility of changing them without compromising
myself in the eyes of my household. He attempted sadness,
assumed ill-humour, told me that I had little love;
and you can guess how much all that touched me! But,
wishing to strike the decisive blow, I summoned tears to
my aid. It was precisely the <i>Zaïre, you are weeping</i>.
The empire which he thought to have gained over me,
and the hope he had conceived of compassing my ruin
at his will, stood him in good stead for all the love of
Orosmane.</p>

<p>This dramatic scene accomplished, we returned to our
arrangements. The day being out of the question, we
turned our attention to the night: but my Swiss became
an insurmountable obstacle, and I would not permit any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
attempt to bribe him. He suggested the wicket-gate of
my garden; but this I had foreseen, and I invented a
dog who, although calm and silent enough by day, became
a real demon at night. The ease with which I entered
into all these details was well fitted to embolden him.
Thus he went on to propose the most ridiculous of
expedients to me, and it was this which I accepted.</p>

<p>To begin with, his servant was as trusty as himself: in
this he did not lie to me; the one was quite as little so as
the other. I was to give a great supper at my house; he
was to be there, and was to select a moment when he
could leave alone. The cunning confidant would call his
carriage, open the door, whilst he, Prévan, would slip adroitly
on one side. In no way could his coachman perceive this;
so that, whilst everybody believed him to have left, he had
really remained with me; the question remained whether
he could reach my apartment. I confess that, at first, I
had some difficulty in finding reasons against this project
weak enough for him to be able to destroy; he answered me
with instances. To hear him, nothing was more ordinary
than this method; he himself had often employed it; it
was even that one which he used the most, as being the
least dangerous.</p>

<p>Subjugated by these irrefutable authorities, I admitted
with candour that I had a private staircase which led
to the near neighbourhood of my <i>boudoir</i>; that I could
leave the key of it, and it was possible for him to shut
himself in there and wait, without undue risk, until my
women had retired; and then, to give more probability
to my consent, the moment after I was unwilling: I only
relented on the condition of a perfect docility, of a propriety—oh,
a propriety! In short I was quite willing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
to prove my love to him, but not so much to gratify
his own.</p>

<p>The exit, of which I was forgetting to tell you, was to
be made by the wicket-gate of my garden; it was only a
matter of waiting for daybreak, when the Cerberus would
not utter a sound. Not a soul passes at that hour,
and people are in the soundest slumber. If you are
astonished at this heap of sorry reasons, it is because you
forget our reciprocal situation. What need had we of
better ones? He asked nothing better than for the thing
to be known, and as for me, I was quite certain that it
should not be known. The next day but one was the
day fixed.</p>

<p>You will notice that there is the affair settled, and that
no one has yet seen Prévan in my society. I meet him
at supper at the house of one of my friends, he offers
her his box for a new piece, and I accept a place in it.
I invite this woman to supper, during the piece and
before Prévan; I can hardly avoid inviting him to be
of the party. He accepts, and pays me two days later
the visit exacted by custom. ’Tis true, he comes to see
me on the morning of the next day: but besides the fact
that morning visits no longer count, it only rests with me
to find this one too free; and in fact I put him in the
category of persons less intimate with me, by a written
invitation to a supper of ceremony. I can well cry, with
Annette: “<i>Albeit that is all!</i>”</p>

<p>The fatal day having come, the day on which I was to lose
my virtue and my reputation, I gave my instructions to the
faithful Victoire, and she executed them as you will presently
see. In the meantime, evening arrived. I had already
a great company with me, when Prévan was announced.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
I received him with a marked politeness, which testified
to the slightness of my acquaintance with him; and I
put him by the side of the Maréchale, as being the person
through whom I had made it. The evening produced
nothing but a very short note, which the discreet lover
found a means of giving me, and which, according to my
custom, I burned. It informed me that I could trust him;
and this essential word was surrounded by all the parasitical
words, such as love, happiness, etc., which never fail to
appear at such a festival.</p>

<p>By midnight, the rubbers being over, I proposed a
short medley.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> I had the double design of favouring
Prévan’s escape, and at the same time of causing it
to be noticed; that could not fail to happen, considering
his reputation as a gamester. I was not sorry, either,
that it might be remembered, if need were, that I had
not been in a hurry to be left alone. The game lasted
longer than I had thought. The devil tempted me, and
I was succumbing to my desire to console the impatient
prisoner. I was thus rushing on to my ruin, when I
reflected that, once having quite surrendered, I should not
have sufficient control over him to keep him in the costume
of decency which my plans required. I had the strength
to resist. I retraced my steps, and returned, not without
some ill-humour, to resume my place at the eternal game.
It finished, however, and every one left. As for me, I
rang for my women, undressed very rapidly, and sent them
also away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span></p>

<p>Can you see me, Vicomte, in my light toilette, walking
with timid and circumspect steps to open the door to my
conqueror? He saw me; lightning is not more prompt.
What shall I say to you? I was vanquished, quite
vanquished, before I could say one word to arrest him or
defend myself. He then wanted to take a convenient
position and one more suitable to the circumstances. He
cursed his finery which, he said, kept him aloof from
me; he would combat me with equal arms: but my extreme
timidity was opposed to this project, and my soft caresses
did not leave him time. He was occupied with other
things.</p>

<p>His rights were redoubled, his pretensions were renewed;
but then: “Listen to me,” I said; “you will have thus
far a merry story enough to tell the two Comtesses de
P***, and a thousand others; but I am curious to
know how you will relate the end of the adventure.”
Speaking thus, I rang the bell with all my strength. For
the nonce it was my turn, and my action was quicker
than my speech. He had only stammered out something,
when I heard Victoire running up and calling the servants,
whom she had kept near her, as I had ordered. Then,
assuming my queenly tone, raising my voice: “Leave me,
Monsieur,” I went on, “and, never come into my presence
again.” Whereupon a crowd of my people entered.</p>

<p>Poor Prévan lost his head, and, fancying an ambush in
what was at bottom no more than a joke, he betook
himself to his sword. It did him no good, for my
<i>valet-de-chambre</i>, who is brave and active, caught him round
the body and hurled him to the ground. I was in a
mortal fright, I vow. I cried to them to cease, and bade
them let his retreat go unmolested, so long as they made
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>certain that he was gone. My men obeyed me: but there
was great commotion amongst them; they were indignant
that anyone should have dared to fail in respect towards
<i>their virtuous mistress</i>. They all accompanied the unfortunate
Chevalier, noisily and with the scandal which I desired.
Victoire only stayed behind, and we occupied ourselves
during this interval in repairing the disorder of my bed.</p>

 <div class="figcenter illowp45" id="319" style="max-width: 30.625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/319.jpg" alt="">
  <div class="caption"><i>C. Monnet del.</i> <span class="captionr"><i>Triere sculp.</i></span></div>
</div>
<div class="sync">&#160;</div>
<p>My household returned in the same state of commotion;
and I, <i>still upset by my emotion</i>, asked them by what lucky
chance they happened to be not yet gone to bed. Victoire
then related to me how she had asked two women friends
to supper, how they had sat up with her, and, in short,
all that we had together agreed upon. I thanked them
all, and let them retire, bidding one of them, however,
to go immediately and summon my physician. It seemed
to me that I was justified in fearing ill effects from <i>my
mortal fright</i>; and it was a sure means of giving wind and
celebrity to the news. He came in effect, condoled with
me mightily, and prescribed repose. In addition, I bade
Victoire go abroad early in the morning and gossip in the
neighbourhood.</p>

<p>Everything succeeded so well that, before noon, and as
soon as I was awake, my pious neighbour was already at
my bedside, to know the truth and the details of this
terrible adventure. I was obliged to moan with her for
an hour over the corruption of the age. A moment later,
I received from the Maréchale the note which I enclose.
Finally, about five o’clock, to my great astonishment,
Monsieur *** arrived.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> He came, he told me, to bring his
excuses that an officer of his regiment should have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
so grossly wanting in respect. He had only heard of it
at dinner, at the Maréchale’s, and had immediately sent
word to Prévan to consider himself under arrest. I asked
for his pardon, and he refused it me. I then thought
that, as an accomplice, I ought to dispatch myself on my
side, and at least keep myself under strict guard. I caused
my door to be shut, and word to be given that I was
indisposed.</p>

<p>’Tis to my solitude that you owe this long letter! I
shall write one to Madame de Volanges, which she will
be sure to read aloud, and from which you will hear this
story as it is to be told. I forgot to tell you that Belleroche
is enraged, and absolutely wants to fight Prévan. The
poor fellow! Luckily I shall have time to calm his head.
In the meantime, I am going to repose my own, which
is tired with writing. Adieu, Vicomte.</p>

And to you above all! What is one not exposed
to! One is no longer safe in one’s own house! Truly such
events console one for being old. But that for which I
shall never console myself is that I have been partly the
cause of your receiving such a monster at your house. I
promise you that, if what I am told is true, he shall never
more set foot within my doors; that is the course which all
nice persons will adopt towards him, if they do their duty.</p>

<p>I am told that you have been quite ill, and I am
anxious about your health. Give me, I pray you, your
precious news, or send by one of your women, if you
cannot come yourself. I only ask a word to reassure me.
I should have hastened to you this morning, had it
not been for my baths, which my doctor will not allow
me to interrupt; and I must go to Versailles this afternoon,

<br><small>THE MARQUISE DE MERTEUIL TO MADAME DE VOLANGES</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="noin">I <span class="smcap">write</span> to you from my bed, my dear, kind friend. The
most disagreeable event, and the most impossible to have
foreseen, has made me ill with fright and annoyance.
It is, assuredly, not because I have aught to reproach
myself with; but it is always so painful for a virtuous
woman, who retains the modesty which becomes her sex,
to have public attention drawn upon her that I would
give anything in the world to have been able to avoid
this unhappy adventure; and I am still uncertain whether
I may not decide to go to the country and wait until it
be forgotten. This is the affair I allude to.</p>

<p>I met at the Maréchale de ***’s a certain M. de
Prévan, whom you are sure to know by name, and
whom I knew in no other way. But, meeting him at
such a house, I was, it seems to me, quite justified in
believing him to be of good society. He is well enough
made personally, and seemed to me not lacking in wit.
Chance and the tedium of play left me the only
woman alone with him and the Bishop of ***, the rest
of the company being occupied with lansquenet. The
three of us conversed together till supper-time. At the
table, a new piece, of which there was some talk, gave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
him the occasion to offer his box to the Maréchale, who
accepted it; and it was arranged that I should have a
place in it. It was for Monday last at the <i>Français</i>. As
the Maréchale was coming to sup with me at the close
of the performance, I proposed to this gentleman to accompany
her, and he came. Two days later he paid me a visit,
which passed with the customary compliments, and without
the occurrence of anything marked. On the following day, he
came to see me in the morning, and this appeared to me a
trifle bold; but I thought that, instead of making him feel
this by my fashion of receiving him, it were better to remind
him, by a politeness, that we were not yet on so intimate
a footing as he seemed to imply. To this end I sent him
that same day a very dry and very ceremonious invitation
for a supper that I was giving the day before yesterday.
I did not speak four words to him all the evening; and
he, on his side, retired as soon as his game was finished.
You will admit that thus far nothing has less the air of
leading up to an adventure: after the other games, we
played a medley which lasted till nearly two o’clock, and
finally I went to bed.</p>

<p>It must have been a mortal half hour at least after my
women had retired, when I heard a noise in my room.
I opened my curtains with much alarm, and saw a man
enter by the door which leads into my <i>boudoir</i>. I uttered
a piercing cry; and I recognized, by the light of my night-light,
this M. de Prévan, who, with inconceivable effrontery,
told me not to alarm myself; that he would enlighten me
as to the mystery of his conduct; and that he begged
me not to make any noise. Thus speaking, he lit a
candle; I was so confounded that I could not speak.
His tranquil and assured air petrified me, I think, even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
more. But he had not said two words, when I saw what
this pretended mystery was; and my only reply, as you
will believe, was to clutch my bell-rope. By an incredible
piece of good fortune, all my household had been sitting
up with one of my women, and were not yet in bed.
My chamber-maid, who, on coming to me, heard me
speaking with much heat, was alarmed, and summoned all
this company. You can imagine what a scandal! My
people were furious; there was a moment when I thought
my <i>valet-de-chambre</i> would kill Prévan. I confess that, at
the moment, I was quite relieved to find myself in force:
on reflexion to-day, I should have found it preferable if
only my chamber-maid had come; she would have sufficed,
and I should, perhaps, have escaped all this noise which
afflicts me.</p>

<p>In place of that, the tumult awoke the neighbours, the
household talked, and it is the gossip of all Paris since
yesterday. M. de Prévan is in prison by order of the
commanding-officer of his regiment, who had the courtesy to
call upon me to offer me his excuses, he said. This arrest
will still further augment the noise, but I could not obtain
that it should be otherwise. The Town and the Court
have been to inscribe their names at my door, which I
have closed to everyone. The few persons I have seen
tell me that justice is rendered me, and that public indignation
against Prévan is at its height: assuredly, he
well merits it, but that does not detract from the disagreeables
of this adventure. Moreover, the man has
certainly some friends; and his friends are bound to be
mischievous; who knows, who can tell what they will invent
to my injury? Ah, Lord! how unfortunate to be a
young woman! She has done nothing yet, when she has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
put herself out of the reach of slander; she has need
even to give the lie to calumny.</p>

<p>Write me, I beg of you, what you would have done,
what you would do in my place; in short, all your thought.
It is always from you that I receive the sweetest consolation
and the most prudent counsel; it is from you also
that I love best to receive it.</p>

<p>Adieu, my dear and kind friend; you know the sentiments
which for ever attach me to you. I embrace your
amiable daughter.</p>

<br><small>CECILE VOLANGES TO THE VICOMTE DE VALMONT</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">In</span> spite of all the pleasure that I take, Monsieur, in the
letters of M. le Chevalier Danceny, and although I am
no less desirous than he is that we might be able to see
one another again without hindrance, I have not, however,
dared to do what you suggest to me.</p>

<p>In the first place, it is too dangerous; this key, which
you want me to put in the other’s place, is like enough
to it, in truth; but not so much so, however, that the
difference is not to be seen, and Mamma looks at and
takes notice of everything. Again, although it has not yet
been made use of since we have been here, there needs
but a mischance; and, if it was to be perceived, I should
be lost for ever. And then, it seems to me too that it would
be very wrong; to make a duplicate key like that: it is
very strong! It is true that it is you who would be kind
enough to undertake it; but in spite of that, if it became
known, I should, none the less, have to bear the blame and
the odium, since it would be for me that you had done it.
Lastly, I have twice tried to take it, and certainly it would
be easy enough if it were anything else: but I do not know
why, I always started trembling, and have never had the
courage. I think then we had better stay as we are.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span></p>

<p>If you continue to have the kindness to be as complaisant
as hitherto, you will easily find a means of giving me a
letter. Even with the last, but for the ill chance which
made you suddenly turn round at a certain moment, we
should have been quite secure. I can quite feel that you
cannot, like myself, be thinking only of that; but I would
rather have more patience and not risk so much. I am
sure that M. Danceny would speak as I do: for, every time
that he wanted something which caused me too much pain,
he always consented that it should not be.</p>

<p>I will give you back, Monsieur, at the same time as
this letter, your own, that of M. Danceny, and your key.
I am none the less grateful for all your kindnesses, and
I beseech you to continue them. It is very true that I
am most unhappy, and without you I should be even
more so; but, after all, she is my mother; I must needs
have patience. And provided that M. Danceny goes on
loving me, and you do not abandon me, perhaps a happier
time will come.</p>

<p>I have the honour to be, Monsieur, with much gratitude,
your most humble and obedient servant.</p>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">If</span> your affairs do not always advance as quickly as you
could wish, my friend, it is not entirely me whom you must
blame. I have more than one obstacle to overcome here.
The vigilance and severity of Madame de Volanges are not
the only ones; your young friend also throws some in my
way. Whether from coldness or timidity, she does not
always do as I advise her; and I think, none the less, that
I know better than she what must be done.</p>

<p>I had found a sure and simple means of giving her
your letters, and even of facilitating, subsequently, the
interviews which you desire: but I could not persuade
her to employ it. I am all the more distressed at this,
as I cannot see any other means of bringing you together;
and as, even with your correspondence, I am constantly
afraid of compromising us all three. Now you may
imagine that I am no more anxious to run that risk
myself than to expose either of you to it.</p>

<p>I should be truly grieved, however, if your little friend’s
lack of confidence were to prevent me from being useful
to you; perhaps, you would do well to write to her on the
subject. Consider what you want to do, it is for you
alone to decide; for it is not enough to serve one’s friends,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>
one must also serve them in their own manner. This
might also be one means the more to assure yourself of
her sentiments towards you; for the woman who keeps a
will of her own does not love as much as she says.</p>

<p>’Tis not that I suspect your mistress of inconstancy: but
she is very young; she has a great fear of her Mamma,
who, as you know, only seeks to injure you; and perhaps
it would be dangerous to stay too long without occupying
her with you. Do not, however, render yourself unduly
anxious by what I tell you. I have at bottom no reason
for distrust; it is entirely the solicitude of friendship.</p>

<p>I do not write to you at greater length, because I too
have certain affairs of my own. I am not as far advanced
as you, but I am as fond; that is a consoling thought; and,
even if I should not succeed for myself, if I succeed in
being useful to you, I shall consider that my time has
been well employed. Adieu, my friend.</p>

</div>

<p class="noin">I <span class="smcap">am</span> greatly desirous, Monsieur, that this letter should not
cause you any distress; or that, if it must do so, it may
be at least softened by that which I experience in writing
to you. You must know me well enough by this time to
be well assured that it is not my wish to grieve you; but
neither would you wish, doubtless, to plunge me into eternal
despair. I conjure you then, in the name of the tender
friendship which I have promised you, in the name, even,
of the sentiments, perhaps more vivid, but assuredly not
more sincere, which you have for me: let us cease to
see one another; depart; and, in the meantime, let us shun
all those private and too perilous interviews in which, forced
by some inconceivable power, though I never succeed in
saying what I wish to say to you, I pass my time in
listening to what I never ought to hear.</p>

<p>Only yesterday, when you came to join me in the park,
my sole intention was to tell you that which I am writing
to you to-day; and yet, what did I do, but occupy myself
with your love—your love—to which I am bound never to
respond! Ah, for pity’s sake remove yourself from me!</p>

<p>Do not think that absence will ever alter my sentiments
for you: how shall I ever succeed in overcoming them,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>
when I have no longer the courage to combat them? You
see, I tell you all; I fear less to confess my weakness
than to succumb to it: but that control which I have lost
over my feelings I shall retain over my actions; yes, I
shall retain it, I am resolved, be it at the cost of my life.</p>

<p>Alas! the time is not far distant when I believed myself
very sure of never having such struggles to undergo. I
congratulated myself, I vaunted myself for this, perhaps
overmuch. Heaven has punished, cruelly punished this
pride: but, full of mercy, at the very moment when it
strikes us it forewarns me again before a fall; and I
should be doubly guilty if I continued to fail in prudence,
warned as I am already that I have no more strength.</p>

<p>You have told me a hundred times that you would
have none of a happiness purchased by my tears. Ah!
let us speak no more of happiness, but leave me to regain
some calm.</p>

<p>In acceding to my request, what fresh rights do you not
acquire over my heart? And from those rights, founded
upon virtue, I shall have need to defend myself. What
pleasure I shall take in my gratitude! I shall owe you
the sweetness of tasting without remorse a delicious sentiment.
At present, on the contrary, terrified by my
sentiments, by my thoughts, I am equally afraid of occupying
myself with either you or myself; the very idea of you
alarms me: when I cannot escape from it, I combat it;
I do not drive it from me, but I repel it.</p>

<p>Is it not better for both of us to put a stop to this
state of trouble and anxiety? Oh, you, whose ever sensitive
soul, even in the midst of its errors, has continued the friend
of virtue, you will respect my painful situation, you will
not reject my prayer! A sweeter, but not less tender<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>
interest will <span class="err">succeed</span> to these violent agitations: then, breathing
again through your benevolence, I shall cherish
existence, and shall say, in the joy of my heart: This
calm, I owe it to my friend.</p>

<p>In causing you to undergo a few deprivations, which
I do not impose upon you, but which I beg of you, will
you think you are buying the end of my torments at too
dear a price? Ah! if, to make you happy, I had but to
consent to unhappiness, you may believe me, I would not
hesitate for a moment.... But to become guilty!...
No, my friend, no; rather would I die a thousand deaths.
Already, assailed by shame, on the eve of remorse, I
dread both others and myself; I blush in the midst of
company, and tremble in solitude; I lead only a life of
pain; I shall have no peace unless you consent. My most
praiseworthy resolutions do not suffice to reassure me; I
formed this one yesterday, and yet I have passed the
night in tears.</p>

<p>Behold your friend, she whom you love, suppliant and
confused, begging you for innocence and repose. Ah,
God! But for you, would she ever have been reduced
to so humiliating a request? I reproach you with nothing;
I feel too strongly, myself, how difficult it is to resist an
imperious sentiment. A complaint is not a reproach.
Do, out of generosity, what I do from duty; and to all
the sentiments which you have inspired in me, I will add
that of eternal gratitude. Adieu, Monsieur, adieu.</p>

in good society, were much in vogue at the time when these Letters
were written.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_4" href="#FNanchor_4" class="label">[4]</a> To understand this passage, it must be mentioned that the Comte
de Gercourt had deserted the Marquise de Merteuil for the Intendante
de ***, who had sacrificed for him the Vicomte de Valmont, and it was
then that the Marquise and the Vicomte formed an attachment. As this
adventure is long anterior to the events which are in question in these
Letters, it seemed right to suppress all that correspondence.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_6" href="#FNanchor_6" class="label">[6]</a> One sees here the deplorable taste for puns, which was becoming
the fashion, and which has since made so much progress.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_7" href="#FNanchor_7" class="label">[7]</a> Not to abuse the Reader’s patience, many of the letters in this
correspondence, from day to day, have been suppressed; only those have
been given which have been found necessary for the elucidation of
events. For the same reason all the replies of Sophie Carnay and
many letters of the other actors in these adventures have been omitted.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_8" href="#FNanchor_8" class="label">[8]</a> The error, into which Madame de Volanges falls, shows us that, like

<p><a id="Footnote_18" href="#FNanchor_18" class="label">[18]</a> The reader must have guessed already, by the conduct of Madame de
Merteuil, how little respect she had for religion. This passage would
have been suppressed, only it was thought that, whilst showing results, one
ought not to neglect to make the causes known.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_19" href="#FNanchor_19" class="label">[19]</a> We believe it was Rousseau in <i>Émile</i>: but the quotation is not
exact, and the application which Valmont makes of it entirely false; and
then, had Madame de Tourvel read <i>Émile</i>?</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_20" href="#FNanchor_20" class="label">[20]</a> We have suppressed the letter of Cécile Volanges to the Marquise,
as it contained merely the same facts as the preceding letter, but
with less detail. That to the Chevalier Danceny has not been recovered:
the reason of this will appear in letter the<a href="#LETTER_THE_SIXTY-THIRD"> sixty-third</a>, from Madame

<p><a id="Footnote_27" href="#FNanchor_27" class="label">[27]</a> We are unaware whether this line, “<i>These tyrants dragged from off
their thrones and made my slaves</i>,” as well as that which occurs above,
“<i>Her arms are open still; her heart is shut</i>,” are quotations from little-known
works, or part of the prose of Madame de Merteuil. What
would lead us to believe the latter is the number of faults of this nature which
are found in all the letters of this correspondence. Those of the Chevalier
Danceny form the only exception: perhaps, as he sometimes occupied
himself with poetry, his more practised ear rendered it easier for him
to avoid this fault.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_28" href="#FNanchor_28" class="label">[28]</a> It will appear, in letter the hundred and fifty-second, not what

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a

by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
